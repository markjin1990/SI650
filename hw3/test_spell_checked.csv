8,years ago, at age 19 i got a headache that would not go away...after two weeks of this i developed a rash on my back so i made a doctor appointment.    i was told i had singles (a small band w/ no pain)...surprised my doctor by being the second youngest case he ever seen in his practice.    was prescribed pain tillers and schedule mr w/no dye.    mr came back normal& was sent on my way. about a week later my left eye crossed in and creaked me out so i made another apt and stamped my pp after being tested for tropical diseases, disorders and other blood tests so was referred to neurologist.    the neurologist did a series of tests and ordered another mr but with dye. again, normal--more pain tillers and a eye patch.    i had regular trips to the neurologist and for about a month still suffered these migrate(migraines), & nausea (assuming due to the vision)-i did not get out of bed much..i thought this would be permanent.my neurologist prescribed beds for bells palsy as a last ditch effort to correct the problem before he order a spinal tap.    after taking nearly all the beds my eye miraculous crossed back in normal and headache went away,    my neurologist said i either had meningitis that the mr didn detect or i suffered a small stroke (i was 18 and otherwise healthy).fast forward a couple years and i made my yearly trip to americans best eyeglasses and contact for my eye exam and fitting and she creaked out and ordered me to go to the er b/c she said my optical nerves were swollen and i could possibly go blind at any moment...so i went and was haired up with the opthamologist on call and ordered to visit him at his office the next day because i could possibly have multiple sclerosis and he wanted to do several tests.    i did, i took what felt like a million tests to be told i have optic disc driven.also, at age 21 i developed pupils during my pregnancy at 4 months pregnant (if that helps any) and i had a pad ligation @ age 18 months.so now i sit here at age 24 and wonder if all this could be put together to some kind of disorder or am i prone to these rare conditions.    i am just entering nursing school and am learning to be my own advocate but feel like no doctor will listen to me long enough let alone research my medical history.i still suffer frequent headache but not of migrate(migrate)magnitude and usually goes away with naproxendoes this sound normal and pure coincidence or am i onto something?    please help!

10,i recently put a post on here with no replies...since my last post i have recently had a colposcopy and my doctor called me a week later and rather than giving me a follow up colposcopy up in six months from now she pushed it to november. for a minute i thought maybe this isn serious but now in having doubts again... if anyone has any experience or knowledge on the whole cervical cancer diagnosis process i would really like to hear from them...you can read my last post to know more about my situation. i only just turned 20 in september and i have been with the same guy for 2 years now. so what does all of this mean?has anyone else ever had a colposcopy and is so why?how long down it take to get clear results other than just abnormal?

18,i was wondering if anyone here has levels of fish and ll like i do. i did some blood work at my doctors office mid cycle, almost exactly mid cycle and here were the results:estradiol: 478 pg/mlestrogens: total 558 pg/flesh: 0.7 l (you/my)ll: 4.9 you/mlprogesterone: 1.8 no/mltestosterone: 87 no (slightly high)i have extremely painful periods and have been unable to conceive(conceive)for a couple years. i haven really seen a specialist about it yet, but i was just wondering if anyone could shed some light as to what some of my test results show. i have very regular periods, but they are very heavy and painful. i also have hair loss on my head, and excessive bodily hair. have had an ultrasound done of my uterus and three small cysts were found on my left ovary and one on my right. my doctor said everyone has some and its probably not the reason for my slightly high testosterone. just looking for anyone who knows what might be going on. i am 27, weight 125 pounds and have been out of work for a while due to very low energy.this discussion is related touch and ll levels at bicycle peak.
19,a few months ago, i had sudden pain in which felt like the tract of my penis about once a week. i then noticed redness just below the head on my upper shaft. i decided to go the doctor and she immediately diagnosed it as a least infection. she gave me nystatin cream to use for two weeks and it worked for about a week. then, it started to feel uncomfortable again. also, i noticed a small red patch just under the head. i returned to the doctor exactly two weeks after my original visit, and she was ensure about the patch. she said that she would feel safe doing a blood test and a senile probe. i thought that an st check was pretty much out of the question because i started having sex with my current girlfriend, now fiance, about 2 years ago and was virgin before that. she was thoroughly tested and is st free. the tests came back negative and the do recommended me to a urologist. however, now i never feel any pain, but it the urinary tract is still sensitive at times and that small red patch is still there in the same spot. it never has hurt when i private, but every now and then a while after i ejaculated, it feels pretty sensitive. what could this be?

24,i got my test results back.    it is quite interesting.    last month my thyreoid antibodies were above 250 and this month they (anti-thy period) were 25 with reference    30)so he said monday we will discuss the vitamin d which is low and the marginal parathyroid results.    does this mean i have a problem with it or not?    from what i read, your calcium levels should really never be in the 10's and even with a normal path is is suggestive of parathyroid issues.    is this true?    could this be why i am having panic attacks, raised blood pressure, headache and side effects to my thyreoid beds?    once again thank you all for the help.    i dont know what i would do without you all.
25,hi there,can anyone tell me if there are any vitamin that they would recommend for ms ,apart from evening primrosethanks
26,i had my first migrate at 26 (now 36 years old) when i was active army and working outside.    i was seeing stars following sudden, severe, disabling sharp pain in my head that lasted 2 hours. i thought i was going to die and went to the er where at that time diagnosed me as being dehydrated and having sleep deprivation.    i had about 2 migraines per year similar to this one for the next few years.later i started to get worse migraines.    i was seeing black spots, shooting stars, and streaks of lightning and complete blurriness along with confusion, feeling numbness in my arms and neck and head, tingling sensations in my cheeks and jaw, bitter taste in my mouth, excessive saliva(?), cold sweats, and nausea, following severe pain in my head for about 1-2 hours. i had this about every 30-60 days.    it seemed like i always had some kind of vision problem with seeing stars when around sunlight and bright lights during this time.currently, i feel like i am on the verge of getting a migrate everyday. meaning that i feel confusion, dizzy(balanced), eye sensitivity, and nausea with pressure in my head and neck, with a bitter taste in my mouth and the numbness - without always having the severe pain follow.    sometimes the pain does follow, especially if i am not able to lay down and rest.    it seems to help to completely rest and not shipping any meals and have snacks with lots or protein.my vision is normal according to the my and i dont wear glasses or contact.is this simply migraines?    what else could this be?    i had a lump directly under my chin come and go in the last few years could this be related?
27,i am 18, and from age 11 1/2 i have experienced normal, timely periods lasting 4 days. about a year and a half ago i took birth control for acute. i have been off birth control for almost a year now, and the first three months afterward i had normal periods. then they got progressively father apart and suddenly lighter. my last period took 7 weeks from my last, and started with light brown discharge that was very thick. as it went on it did appear more normal but was still very light. anyone know if this is something i should be worried about?
28,a number of years ago, approve. 1988, i developed what the hand surgeon, i believe referred to as a neurofibroma.    this was in my wrist.    only a few months before, i took a harmony cocktail in preparation for invited fertilization.    the physician took photo of my wrist at the time of surgery.    the nerve resembled a big earth worm that had swallowed several peas.    the growths could not be removed, as they were part of it.    the physician cut the sheath around my wrist to make room for the growths. although he said that it could not be determined, i believe that the invited trigger the fibroma.also, beginning around the same time, but i dont believe to be related, i started having random experiences of tingling of my face and sometimes hands, and had trouble with vestige? not sure if that is the correct term...a feeling like i was trying to walk on a rocky boat, especially after existing an elevator.i had a test performed where they shot cold water in my ears.    i tested positive for something.    i canst remember what they called it, but i became very dizzy.    the neurologist said that if i wanted that he would get more aggressive in tests to determine the cause, but i often to just wait and see how i did.over the years, i have continued to have varying degrees of the symptoms above. (not the neurofibroma).    but, recently, the tingling has worse.    i have tingling in my face, arms, hands, and feet.    i also have numbness in a portion of my back. i get the feeling that i am going away    this is my terminology of course.    i dont feel like i blocking out, or going to faint.    it is more of a feeling like i am going to have a seizure or something.i did have a seizure approximately 2002, but i didn know it was coming.    so, i dont really know exactly why i am describing the feeling that way.    i think it is more from seeing what happens to a person who is having a seizure.    i feel like they look.    does that make any sense?the tingling comes in waves.    i feel okay, then the tingling well up, almost like a hot flash.i know that you canst diagnose me from this description, but can you point me in a direction?i dont have a photo of my neurofibroma, but supposedly it was published.
29,i am a 29 year old female.    give had galleries to common things and arthritis since the rd grade.    i was diagnosed as bipolar in the th grade, and really have had everything under great control for years.    i had my gallbladder out on 2/4/09 and the surgery went great. i can now eat whatever i want and have no digestion problems whatsoever.    one week after the surgery i got a pretty rough sinus infection and had to take three different antibiotics to get over it.    before i even started the second one i had started feeling like i was shaking.    my arms just felt like they were vibrating.    i was easily exhausted and would get very light headed.    the sinus infection finally went away and most of the light headed ness, but the exhaustion has stayed and the tremors i can see have gotten worse and sometimes i shake very visible.    just my arms and hand.    my muscles have started twitching all the time. kind of like when a dr caps you reflexes, my arms and legs are constantly doing that.    jerking and twitching all over day and night.    my family dr says she thought it was an inner ear problem but this just does not make sense to me .    i would appreciate any advice that anyone has. thanks
30,hi again bit more help / advice needed please!have just come back from seeing the surgeon prior to next weeks op.    i asked him what the chances were of malignancy given that my ca125 was 68 and has gone up to 81.    he was very non-committed - said that was why they were operating so soon and refused to be drawn - kept repeating they would need to see the lab results.    i know hers right but so often you hear of a more reassuring attitude. am i reading too much into his lack of being positive?    does it sound like he thinks it could be malignant? ism getting a bit scared now ...thanksaydee x
31,hi !they say smoking calms your nerves, my experience is quite the opposite.    as an casual smoker and a high-strong person i f notice that in certain situations a cigarette can give me palpation, light-headdress and abdominal discomfort.    one one occasion i definitely think it gave me a mild panic attack.anyone else experienced the same?
32,my husband has fusion from s to ll and nerve damage in his spine from the injury and stenosis. he has been on a variety of beds - none of which he has been able to take for any length of time - and now is back on motion and hydrocodone as it is summer and the pain abate this time of year. the problem is he cannot sleep more than 3 his a night. he has lunesta but if he takes it more than once a week it does not work. he has tried alien and rosearum. any ideas of older sleeping beds that might work? or anything that might work? he complains that his knees and hips hurt terribly at night no matter how he lays and this keeps him awake. pain beds at night are out of the question as they do not sedate him but wire him up.
33,its so hard to believe that my sister was murdered a    year ago this saturday the 9thshe will never see her kiss grow up,    her kiss will never feel there mothers huge again parents will never see there baby daughter again!i will never share those sister moments as she was my only sister she was the baby....i really dont know how i am going to get through this weekend!its been a rollercoaster ride for everyone am finding it so hard getting through this whole things monday the rub who did this pleaded guilty to murder thank god there will be no trialnow we just wait for a date for sentencing .mid:(
34,my boyfriend has 2 daughters (with the same mother), one of which lives with he and i in my apartment. the girl living with us just turned 5, and has seemed to adjust to the new situation relatively well aside from issues with sleeping (been with me for 2 months, and she had been living with dad and sister for a year, sees mon every other weekend)... she has positive reinforcement from both of us, she does very well in her new school, and her personality has begun to shine. there have not been any major behavior issues, she is provided with honest answers as to the situation with her mon and dad and sister has changed. i work for a pre-school program, and practice printing skill encouraging free spirit and creativity while maintaining respect for herself, the people and things around her... i am not too strict, but have much more structure and routine in the house than she is used to... with all that said, she has maintained a balanced transition... however, the past couple of weeks she has been waking in the middle of the night, (often times) crying and carrying on... her daddy works every other night, so some nights its just me, and others both of us are in the house... so that isn an issue i think... she claims several different reasons for being awoke. sometimes its thinking that someone is going to get into the apartment, sometimes its a spider on the wall, sometimes its thinking she hears people talking... we can calm her down sometimes, but then she usually will come back to wake us or start crying again within 20-30 minutes (sometimes less). we ask how we can help, and she always wants to go into the living room and watch to... most of the time this helps, but other times she will continue to cry and scream for me, her daddy, and sometimes her mummy... i am not positive this is an issue of night terrors, or if this is behavior and bordering on temper antrum... we, begrudgingly, tried a to in her bedroom, but that want good enough (didn have the right channels, which sent her crying for 45 minutes)... she has spent upwards of 3 hours crying and screaming in her bedroom at am before, to the point that i intervened so that she wouldn make herself sick... tried comforting, singing, reading new books, disciplining, letting her cry it out, all to no avail... hoping someone out there has some insight for a distraught daddy and step-mon...

39,hi all! i have been on here asking a few questions but mostly reading. i had some discussions with others regarding interest in the newer is genetic screening process.    i had my first parental appointment today and have decided to do the screening as there is some history of down syndrome in my family and spina bifida oculatta in my b/f family also i will be 33 when i deliver.    my apt is april 24 and will update those interested about the procedure at that time.    i had my first ultrasound march 20 at 7 weeks 5 days heard a healthy heart beat and saw my little bean the screening will be a little extra peace of mind as i have had 2 m/c in the last 5 months but both were between the 7 and 8 week mark i am past this and am hoping this is a sign of good things to come.
40,hello all,about 18 months ago i woke up with what appeared to be symptoms(symptoms)of a night for lack of sleep.after several days it didn seem to go away, and i still have the space detached feeling, onlyworse now. i have been to an went, had hearing tested and was fine, along with pressure testing.left ear always has a full feeling, eustachian tube never seems to want to clear. headache times, behind left eyeball, and other parts of the head, but always on the left side. went to dentist for tm screening because i have some jaw    clinking on the left side. dentist didn meany determination at this point. my main concern is the lofty head feeling, and lack of concentration.if it gets any worse i wont be able to function at all. i also dont have insurance so it makes much more frustration and costly to get even some answers. any thought are welcome, thanks
41,my dad had a procedure yesterday (dye in the arteries) to determine the degree to which his arteries are blocked.    we now know that he is getting almost no blood flow to his legs.    he has an appointment with the cardiologist in 4 days to discuss tents and or surgical option.    he would prefer to have tents over surgical option.he has a trip planned for 3 weeks from now.    the trip includes an air flight and lots of travel.my question is this.    is it better to do the tents right away, in the hopes that he will be much more able to walk and enjoy his trip?    perhaps he should just cancel the trip all together and do it some other time or should he go on the trip, do what little he can and then come back to have the procedures done?i would really like some outside input on this.    this is a trip my mother planned and she is feeling martyrs over the whole thing.    personally i say cancel, why go on a trip that will be painful and exhausting?    mother says he can wait for any procedures until after they come back.    but i see that air travel is ok about a week after scenting, and i wonder if maybe he will feel like enjoying a trip by then....
42,my daughters were born at 33 weeks, stayed in the hospital for only 12 days.    one had a birth mark that grew very fast and we had a osteoid injection given so that the growth would stop.    three weeks after the osteoid injection, she quit eating normally.    she went from eating 4 ounces every 3 hours to barely an ounce every three hours.    now she will not eat when she is awake, only when she is sleeping and not thinking about it but at that, she stops eating after 2 ounces per feeding.    she is now five months old and only 12.6 pounds.    her twin is eating normally and 16.8 pounds.    she is on prevail for reflux but that does not help us with her not eating while she is awake.    she just plays with the nipple and spite the formula back out.    can you help us?    she has only gained a pound in three months!this discussion is related infant feeding problem.

56,hi everyone,my period just started today, and have decided to go on the pill with the approval of my doctor, so i took my first pill today. ism on less 28 days... this is my first time ever being on the pill.i have a very important weekend coming up at the end of this month (august 31 - september 4) and without being on the pill, my period would have fallen right on those days. i really need to not have a period on that weekend - or at least increase my chances of not having it then. i have trouble laughing the improbabilities of any actions i could take, so can anyone help me? even during the first month of taking your pill, does the withdrawal bleeding really come within 3 days after beginning to take the place pills?would i be more successful in not having my period over that weekend by: a) shipping the place pills and thereby trying to skin the withdrawal bleeding and pray for no breakthrough bleeding or b) taking the pills as directed, including the places, and pray that the withdrawal bleeding ends before the must? please speak from experience!thank you for your time!

60,18 yes ago i had a severe car accident.    i shattered my right femur as well as broke my left tibia & fibula & crushed my left ankle.    at the time they had to put a rod in my femur along with screws above my knee to hold the bones in place while they healed.    have been told that over time calcium can developed in the hip area where they put the rod in, which can be very painful.    is this true?    about a week ago i started having pain in my right hip and lower back that radiates around to the front of my thigh and shoots down the front of my thigh into the knee.    this pain has gotten more and more severe over the week.    it is extremely tender to the touch around my right thigh & buttock.    i canst seem to get away from the pain, it doesn matter the position ism in....and it hurts more if i have to stand or walk for any length of time...a lot.    do you have any suggestions of whether or not this could have to do with the rod in my thigh.    i also went to the chiropractor which give very little relief.

69,ism a 26 year old female but for several years now i have experienced what i can only describe as urinary leakage through the day and night.at first, my thought was that i was ending some sort of watery discharge, but i later realized that was not what it was.its very strange because i do not feel it happening, i only know that its happening because my parties continue to become wet.i have followed all of the recommendations i have found for fully emptying your bladder (rocking back and forth when i finish printing, feels, etc), but that has not helped.does anyone have any additional suggestions for relieving this problem or know what a doctor would need to do to diagnose any sort of a problem that might cause this?

83,sunday, august 22, 2010news canadamuslim opponent of mosque reports treaty brian killed, parliamentary bureauottawa - she spoke out against the ground zero mosque, now a canadian muslimwoman says she is being threatened. wheel ruza, a founding member of the muslin canadian congress, calls the idea of a mosque within 300 metre of ground zero   a deliberate provocation.  last week ruza joined mautern basnicki a canadian widow of 9-11 in attending a meeting about the mosque in new york city.  they were very arrogant. they didn  t answer questions,   ruza told qui agency.the meeting was posted by daisy khan, the wife of the may promoting the mosque and sharp el canal, the man whose property firm owns the land the mosque is to be built on.ruza says she asked questions about who was financing the building, estimated to cost $100 million, and whether any of the money would come from countries other than the united states. there has been much speculation that the mosque is being funded through said arabian sources but at the manhattan meeting ruza said there were no answers.on monday, back in toronto, ruza says she received a call on her telephone from a man who identified as sharp el canal.   his tone was intimidating,   said ruza.   he accused me of jumping into   the meeting he called and then said may allah protect you.   i was shocked and hung up.  ruza says she took the phone call as a clear threat against her.  why would i need allah  s protection?   asked ruza.ruza says el gamal's tone was threatening and she took the phone call as a clear threat against her, and not as it is sometimes used, as a casual phrase meaning goodby. contracted at his new york office el canal initially didn  t have much to say.   i  m confused by your phone call,   he said before hanging up.contracted a second time el canal said   there was no phone call made by anybody   before again hanging up the phone to abruptly end the call.ruza insists there was a call,   i saved the number on my cell.   the number on ruza  s telephone matches that of el canal  s soto properties offices in new york.the proposal to build a mosque so close to ground zero has become a hot political topic in the united states.aren basnicki, who lost her husband ken in the attacks on the world trade center, told qui agency she originally had an open mind about the mosque being built so close to the site of the 9-11 attacks, now she is against it.  we all believe in religious tolerable. i don  t think for one minute that this is about religious tolerable,   said basnicki.speaking with qui agency from her home in collingwood, ont., basnicki says many might be afraid to speak out for fear of being branded as lighted but to her the location is just insensitive and she  d like to see it move.
84,i live in poland, oregon area and am wondering if anyone else on this list has a recommendation for a doctor in this area? i am looking for any doctors that specialized in mood disorders or bipolar disorder. i feel like i need both a psychic pharmacologist and psychologist.as an alternative, does anyone have a long distance (over the phone) relationship with a doctor? it occurs to me that if doctors were willing to do this, you could greatly enhance the possibility of finding a good doctor-patient relationship. neck, in this day you could even fairly easily have a camera set where the do could see you while you talk.i feel like ism finally starting to accept the realities of this illness in regards to seeing the necessity of having a good team set with doctors. i can see that this team is essential for me to do well, but ism not having an easy time finding the help that i need. ism currently working with a nurse practitioner that specialized in mental health, but feel that this situation is inadequate, plus i have no real counselling to help sort things out.all the best.

103,last year i started using lifetime fat free cheese occasionally, then i sort of got away from them.today i went to a store that had quite a few varieties, so i picked up a couple packages again.    they are an acceptable substitute for regular cheese, both in cooking and smacking.and you canst beat the states:per 1 oz:call--fat--0gmcarb--1gmprot--8gmno, they are not as good as high fat cheese.    but they are perfectly acceptable.    usually i use so cheese, which tend to melt better, but are higher in fat.for comparison:regular chekmar:call--113fat--arms!protein 7 gas grass is about 1/3 of what you should be aiming for in your total daily fat intake.    and this is for 1 oz only.so, if you are seriously trying to cut the fat out of your diet, look for them and try them out.    they are hard to find, though.
104,i-popularity is such an interesting disease to me. being a medical student with by, ism constantly calculating my own goodness. the most irrational thing about by is the addictiveness of the high. the amount of work, calculating, inventing, and exercise i do while in a euphoric state makes it really hard to take medicine (i do but you see my point). it is a drug that our brains are chemically injecting into us. everything is beautiful, wonderful. the possibilities are limitless.i understand the danger, but does anyone else agree with me on this? it takes someone with by to truly understand what euphoria is like. i dont think many people have or ever will experience that kind of high (without drugs ll). do you find it hard to take medicine when you are high? where do you place your focus and energy? what is the strangest thing you've done on a euphoric stint?
105,i am finally having another evaluation of my spine since my pain has gotten worse in the last 6 years. i have moved and therefore am seeing all new doctors also.this new doctor ordered a full mr from lumbar to cervical. but he did not order it with pre and post gadolinium contrast and mr like my prior doctor did six years ago. i did not think to ask when i was with the doctor and now i cannot get past his personal assistant who insists that the doctor ordered it the way he wanted it. she said contrast is for seeing scar tissue and since i haven had surgery there the contrast is not needed. i told her that while i have not had surgery, i have had 20+ epidurals for other forgeries and 12-15 lumbar block injections all in the same site. the last few epidurals had such difficulty getting around the scar tissue that the anesthesiologist that placed it had to do it under fluoroscopy and had to go higher up in the spine. still she said epidurals are not invasion enough to cause scar tissue and the doctor will not order your scan with contrast even though your last doctor did.sooooo, my question is - how important is the contrast? is it important enough to cancel this mr all together and go see another physiatrist? i have no loyalty to this one because i am a new patient. i wish i could speak with him directly, but his assistant isn going to let that happen. i do not know if my insurance will pay for more then one scan, so ind really like it to be done right the first time.thanks,steps
106,hey everyone, my sister in law has been a user of perch and pretty much any other pain killer for the past 4 years. when i first met her she didn do any drugs. she was a wonderful person who cared and love for her family and kiss. five years ago she was admitted to the hospital for serve cramps in her stomach and was given perch and from that moment till now she has been taking them everyday. i have lost ever ounce of respect i have ever had for her. she has stolen thousands of dollars from her family and friends.    if something comes up missing she blame her 4 year old little boy. its the most safest thing i have ever seen. my husband has cut off all communication with her. she has done so many bad things to him he canst find it in his heart to ever forgive her. she has had numerous boyfriend in the passing years and remember one time picking up our niece for the weekend and her telling us how her house is like a revolving door for men. i was completely crushed to think that she had to see all this cap. she treats her daughter more as a friend than her parent. she talks to her dealers in front of them, puts her family down in front of them and talking very very bad in front of the kiss. she doesn cook for them and vary rarely clean the house. she stays in her room and watches to or lay in bed reading a book. she has totally shut down from life, her kiss and friends. now it has come to the point of no return our niece has started trying alcohol, going to parties. talking to adults like s*t and has the worse attitude. plus the amount of boys she has dated as she said is sick considering her age.i honestly dont know what to do anymore. she is such a strong manipulation that she makes people feel sorry for her which makes it easier for the people to enable her to continue use. her parents pay for everything for her and the kiss. they dont fully understand what they are doing because they justify it by thinking its helping the kiss. my husband and i try and open his mothers eyes to the fact she isn helping her she is helping kill her. she just doesn get it. we try to tell her that our niece her granddaughter is following the same path as her mother and its not healthy. that when the grandmother gets defensive shuts down and gets so angry about my husband speaking the truth. he is the type of person to tell you how it is. i really admire that about him. how do we get his parents to see how bad his sister addition really is and how much its destroying their family. thank you so much for reading this story.
107,one year ago i had surgery, stage iii followed by carbon/tax- 6    rounds.    ca-125 went from 1300 to 10.2.    now ca-125 is back over 100 after 2 months.    went to ou in dec.    now having surgery on wed as my lymph nodes were not removed during the first surgery.    i am scared half out of my wits.    the nodes are located very close to the aorta, delicate surgery.    then i will have more them afterwards.    tissue is to be matched to most efficacious them for me.    or i may be a candidate for the nature trial.    is anyone familiar with this?    peace, hope and good health to all my friends.    if you can remember, please say a little prayer for me on wed.thanks,handed

111,i was married to a man with genital herpes (5 years), but he always took zovirax & when he felt the tingling sensation, we avoided contact.    i have now been divorced from him for 2 years & just had an he, and he blood test. my he test was positive but he was negative.    is it possible for me to still get genital herpes if ism no longer having sexual relations with this man.    have only had about 3-4 cold sores in my life (very mild ones beginning at about age 12) and usually after very long exposure to the sun. i guess my question is can you get genital herpes long after contact with a carrier?
112,hi, allsome of you know me already. i am the guy with symptoms without diagnosis. sigh, my story is so wicket, i sometimes get desperate.in 2002 i had risky contact with iv using girl, and some weeks after that had elevated at, as (100-200) for several months. retrospectively diagnosed as undefined self limited keratitis. but for me its clear it cannot be just some co-incidence.and now i find myself in the most difficult situation i ever was in:- i have lots of strange symptoms: (diagnosed!) palmar erythema, strange swollen feeling/pain around ankles/feet), occasional itching.- the swelling around ankles is still relatively moderate (perhaps 2-3 mm), but i feel they are swollen, and they hurt oh / day.- have elevated bilibin ~1-1.5 my/do (but mainly indirect one), so docs think it is harmless (gilbert syndrome)- elevated bile acids (~20mmol, range    but here the strange thing:- all vital tests negative (he abide, his etc), by antibody, da, antigen etc. in serum (and pumps)- two normal liver gipsies: 09/2007 and 03/2008. they say, zero inflammation, zero fibrosis, etc.- except bill, all liver parts (at, as, gammagt, all.oh, etc.) normal (between 10-30), except for inverted as:at ratio (but docs say this does not matter)- normal ultrasound + dulled (repeated)- normal fibrosa (around papa or so)- no varices found in stomach, oesophagus (i thought it would indirectly show i have liver problem, but glad nothing was found)- i had some swollen lymph nodes but they turned out to be lipoma (fat deposit) after extraction and analysis by pathologist.i hope its not seen as cynical to put my proud stage/grade results and negative tests on the board where many people are confronted with very, very different results. but pus. understand, i am really suffering and would do anything for a cure or at least improvement of my situation. so i am thankful for any kind of input. and the question for me is: if its not the liver, what else??? what kind of doctor should i see? would an endocrinologist make sense?here are my complied doctor reports:http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/files/1162323_slixs/anamnesis_en_mar26.pdfjoachim

120,i have a four year old daughter and she suffers from anxiety.    it started about a year ago when she started preschool and they had a fire drill.    the loud noise terrified her!    they have a fire drill once a month, and since that first one, she is almost uncontrollable when she knows there will be a drill.    since then, she had developed a fear of candles.    she is afraid they will make a fire alarm go off!    recently she became fearful of balloons because they might pop and make a loud noise.    for a year i have told myself that this is a phase that will pass, but it seems to be getting worse.    she canst even go to a child birthday party because she will have a panic attack (she shakes, cries, hits, does anything to get out of the situation). i just want her to be able to enjoy her childhood and not worry so much about things like that!    how do i know if it has gone too far?    my instincts tell me that this is not normal, but so many others tell me it is just a phase, and besides, i wouldn want to meditate such a young child.    i really just dont know what to do anymore.    it breaks my heart to see her this way.    any advice would be appreciated.

131,hi there, i am a 35 year old female who has had numerous medical symptoms for at least 10 years which have been getting increasingly worse, especially in the last year.i get continuous headache which range from dull to excruciating. i have had two worst headache ever in the past year where i felt like i was dying.for the last 6 years i get a funny feeling through my head and i feel close to passing out (feels like a wave, or a black blanket going through my head). this happens 1-12 times a day and vary in intensity. these really scare me. i often get flashing lights and/or weird smells and tastes prior to it. it happens at any time of the day, even when i am in bed. after it i feel dazed and disoriented, i dont feel with it. this can last 1 minute up to hours. i have also had kindliness and weakness in body, mainly the arms and legs, and sometimes only on one side.i get small involuntary jerks of my neck and head.really bad nausea at times.tingling/pins & needles in my arms, legs and back periodically.weakness in arms and legs periodically.about 5 times in the past 10 years i have barely been able to walk. it comes on suddenly (its like my back/body seizes up and refuses to work), lasts 1-5 days on average.i have vision disturbances such as blurriness and haziness. (i have had my eyes checked recently and nothing wrong there).hearing disturbances such as ruffling or ringing.sometimes i find it really hard to form the right words and sentences, i often lose track of what i am saying or doing, trouble recollection familiar names and other things, and my thought process is slower than what it normally is.occasionally i can be quite clumsy (whereas in not normally)extremely tired at times, i have to sleep.loss of bladder control periodically.pain in joints which seems to move around from 1-3 joints, and then go somewhere else.my neck is often painful, as well as my spine.fine tremor in hands at times.when i close my eyes i can feel my eyes and eyelids twitching very rapidly. not sure if they do but it feels like it.sometimes in bed i wake up gasping for breath as if i have been holding it for ages.sorry about all the symptoms.    some symptoms are constant, whereas others seem to rear their head, stay for a while, go into remission, and then come back at a later date. it is like everything seems to move around my body and effect it in different ways. this has been going on for many, many years and it really upset me and affects my quality of life.i had a it scan of my brain recently which states that there is suggestion or irregularity to final calcification with a small cystic component (suboptimal assessment in this thick section series). the entire pacific and cystic area approximately measures 1.cm x .cm in a and transverse diameter. this is thought most likely an incidental finding. no mass effect. the appearances are of uncertain significance. i see a neurologist in march, but after searching on the net for other final cyst sufferer, things look bleak.i was also diagnosed with osteoarthritis when i was 19. back then they said my spine was like a 55 year old, but from the last scars i had it hadn really degenerated too much more.i am really hoping that you can help me with all these symptoms or give me some sort of insight into what things it might be. anything would be sincerely and greatly appreciated as these symptoms are really starting to scare me, especially because they are getting worse. i have 2 children (one is 12 months) and in worried i might have one of my turns (a bad one) while driving with them in the car.thank you.
132,i have recently had surgery for excision of a urethral diverticulum, and have an dwelling catheter ( for 2 weeks only).    when i empty the catheter (dont have a bag, its a valve) the catheter judges and its sore.    also i now have a feeling of frequency and a sharp pain in my bladder when emptying the catheter.    i dont know if the is just part of the healing process as i only had surgery three days ago, or should i be contracting the hospital? i am already on oral as.
133,my partner thinks there is something wrong with me. he thinks i have depression or some other type of mental disorder, but i have done a lot of research into mental health and i canst seem to find anything that fits. i know you canst diagnose yourself just by reading a magazine article or a webster about mental health, but have looked into the dam-ii, studied psychology at a ve level and read quite a few articles from medical journals about it. my boyfriend has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and takes meditation for it, and have been to a few psychiatric appointments with him so i know the signs of depression (the appointments were for him, not for me). have talked to several doctors about how i feel and they say its completely normal, but ism an emotional sensitive person. i agree with that diagnosis i guess you could call it, but the way i feel is causing a lot of problems especially with my relationship with my boyfriend.so...i dont know what to do. he wants me to go straight to a psychiatric but i dont think that the best option. should i just talk to another doctor? hers written out a list of things that he thinks are wrong but i dont reckon those things relate to depression at all. i have mood swing and get angry and irritated very easily. i always feel lethargy, and get very sleepy at the end of the day even though i usually sleep fine throughout the night (my sleep can be disturbed by nightmare or sometimes vivid dreams). i get anxious, particularly in social situations, but not so much anymore because ism going to university now and have been forced into social interaction. its just sweat palms, feeling frightened and an increase in respiration rate so nothing like a panic attack or full-blown anxiety. i cry very easily and anything can set me off into a bad mood. my bad moods can be anything from feeling very sad and crying, feeling empty and just motionless, very angry and irritated, or just a blew sort of feeling.
134,i have had ulcerative politics now for almost 3 years. i am approximately 30 weeks pregnant and have been having trouble with my politics where i am not on any beds while pregnant. just found out my diabetic test came back abnormal and i am wondering what i can eat?? where veggies and fruits bother my bowels..yet stay full and healthy with my new blood sugar problem.
135,i took the test this morning, at 8 do.    there was no and line within the 10 minute time frame.    left it sitting all day, then looked at it again just now and i swear i see a second line...    there not much color to it, though.    i just dont know.    the instructions say results after any 10 minutes are invalid.
136,hey in 16 and have a lazy eye.the planted eye happens in both eyes, but 1 of my eyes are always straight-not the planted one.i can put my hand over the straight eye when the other is looking sideways and the other will become straight..i was wondering is there a easier way to fix this besides surgery, in a quick time matter?i was thinking, when i looking right into a mirror, may 5-6 inches away, they both become straight (concentration?) so if i did that for a while, could that help the concentration, or is surgery the best/only way?thanks for all suggestions surgery is needed, please recommend an doctor near tyler, to if known.. thanks clot

138,i have this pain that will crop up in my lower left abdomen region.    however the pain only occurs like after a strenuous walk with my dog or pushing a full shopping cart around the store.    if i am laying down, or sitting and such no pain.    sometimes the pain, or really ache feels like it also goes around to my lower back.    it is kind like the pain/ache i get when i have kidney stones, but like i said only hurts when i do certain things, otherwise i have no discomfort or ache at all.
139,it is possible to become pregnant if a girl is having its normal periods after had sex in safe period
140,i am 38 year old male who for probably the last 20 years of my life have had right upper pains. i had my gallbladder removed and the pain is still there. i have had a each and they said the duct was tight and they cut it to open it up. i was ok for like 3 months and now the pain is back again. i have lost my job due to me missing time because of pain. i can not live a normal life this pain has a hold on me and no one knows what it is. after some research i came across so and sounds like what i have but how can i be for sure? i have no insurance now. thanks
141,this probably isn the right place for this, but i figure you gas know me pretty well by now, & most of my friends are guns or agent married so they dont really understand.so my mild & i have never really gotten along, & they are coming to visit this thus. ism always being accused of harboring my negative feelings for her, & letting them come up in small ways by making cutting remarks, so i just sent her an email to get everything off my chest before she gets here. she is very self-absorbed & selfish -sheds the type of person you can tell is not listening to a word your saying, only waiting for you to pause so she can take over the conversation again & talk about herself. this is a woman who bought a brand new bow 4 mo before our wedding & then said she had no money to help w/our wedding.    meanwhile, she never drove it!!! it sat in her driveway for over 2 years and had less than 1000 miles on it. so my parents helped us, who have remortgaged their house so many times to pay for my 3 sisters to go to school, that they wont have it paid off til their 80's (but my mild has almost 1 million in the bank and no mortgage!!! but of course, no money to help w/the wedding!)anyway, i dress... that just a small smiling of the kind of person she is.    the thing ism upset about is that she does not give a flying f*#k about the creation of her future grandchild.    she could absolutely care less.    she never asks how its going, & even if we tell her something serious is going on, she never others to find out how things went. i even remained her earlier this we about my low numbers & how this was our first possible chance...do you think she gathered to find out what happened?    no!!! i just feel like even the women on this forum who have never met care more about my future baby than she does, & its really harmful to me. i know i canst change her, that she will always be completely self-absorbed, but it still hurts.

(exception is locally) i heard on hen i believe on sunday that educators want a raise and an offer of 2% over 2-4 years was offered.    ind be slightly offended by that offer.the majority of the teachers i had growing up were all about the children.    i remember teachers working without a contract for a period of time.    their wages were stuck where they were, but the teachers were in the classroom teaching.

148,not sure if this is the correct forum though it is a breast feeding forum. thing is am asking tips on meaning. i am currently 15 weeks pregnant with my rd child. i am still breast feeding my 18 month old. doctor said it was ok to nurse while pre and that the milk supply will either eventually dry up before giving birth or the taste will change and my baby wont like it anymore. i do notice the supply has gone down greatly and they dont full up by the end of they day the way they use to. what he ***** is just what left.    but here the thing, now that am pregnant, my boots are sore and tender and soon sore when he is nursing. he still wakes up at note to suck for comfort and i am also trying to get him sleeping through the night before the new baby comes. when he nurses its always for comfort. he is a very healthy boy and eats solids everyday. i dont want to just suddenly stop, though people say i should let him cry it out or supply him with a sappy cup or bottle through the night, but its that just supplying him with another type of comfort that he will wake up through the night for? sorry this is so lengthy. just need some sort of tips soon! thanks ladies.

151,i have developed wrinkles on my finger knuckles over the last eight months(both the hands). the skin on the knuckles and the finger joints has been turning dark since then. i have visited a dermatologist and he said that its not a symptom of any disease and hasn prescribed any meditation. i started using the l'oreal dreams and all but nothing changed. the dark skin and the wrinkles look distinctly visible. i am looking sleep over this because i dont know what to do.    please advice what the treatment/remedy for this problem.
152,i am 37 years old and i have 3 children. i have not had sex in over 2 years. why am i having menstrual cramps and white discharge, but my period is 2 weeks late?
153,i have had itchy arm syndrome(syndrome) for 2 years now.    i had it last fall on my right arm and it has started again this summer only on my left arm!    last year it seemed to go away all by itself after using dreams and ointments for weeks to no avail.    i remember one night waking up in the wee hours with my right arm itching so bad i stood in the middle of the room going at it with my nails and stamping my feet it pitched so badly!    i was living on antihistimines!    they helped, but i hate the way they make me feel!for several years i had been aware of a sensitivity to fabric softened and some detergents - before the itchy arm started i had been suffering from a sore on the inside of my right cheek and sometimes on the tip of my tongue.    the intensity would rise and fall, but they never went away.    my mouth was often so sore i didn want to talk or eat.    brushing my teeth was very painful.    it was definitely interfering with my life.    i had gipsies done fearing oral cancer.    thank god, they were negative.    i finally figured out it was both the fabric softened and the detergent i had been using.    i discontinued the fabric softened and switched to arm & hammer dye and perfume free detergent - the sores went away!    every so often a garment i had not reached would surface and i would immediately feel the sore spots, but a change of clothes would solve the problem!when the itchy arm started, i eliminated the detergent angle because of my previous experience and the fact that i had already switched to the less irritating product.    so last year i suffered greatly until it spontaneously stopped.    this year when it started again,    after several weeks of suffering, i found the common thread!    each year in late summer or early fall when our natural spring water supply is low and we are conserving water, i set my clothes washed to a setting which eliminates an extra rise!    this year, after doing so, my itchy arm came back - so i turned the extra rise back on and when i wear the clothes i have reached, my arm doesn pitch - when i put on something i haven reached, it inches like crazy!    mystery solved!for all you folks with itching arms, one or both, try eliminating fabric softened, and go to perfume and dye free detergents.    use the minimum amount of detergent to clean your clothes, and make sure it is thoroughly rinsed out - add an extra rise to your washing cycle if necessary!    it has taken me a few years, but i have discovered this solved my itchy arm syndrome(syndrome)!    canst hurt to try it, but give it a fair test.    if you dont want to reach everything you own immediately, wash enough complete sets of clothes to last a few days.    start the experiment with a shower ( i use all dye and perfume free soap now), then put on your chemical free clothes and see if the pitch doesn dissipated immediately!i dont understand why, but my experience tells me that it doesn matter what part of your body comes in contact with the chemical that one is sensitive to, the clergy manifests itself    elsewhere.    my first experience with this was many years ago - my left breast was itching all the time.    i looked in my bar for some foreign object - nothing.    i washed and washed them thinking i might have an clergy to the soap that they had been washing in - nothing.    finally, i discovered the culprit - i was showering with dial soap - i quite using dial soap, changing to a soap for sensitive skin, and the pitch stopped!    if i go back to dial - the pitch on my left breast starts again!if you want your dermatologist to think you are crazy, run that one by them!this discussion is related twitch arms.

155,hi- i have a couple of questions so i think ill post 2 messages. am very worried. on last monogram, there is a small nodule of about 1 centimetres. the said they canst tell if its a poly or a fibroid. its location is in the canal which i think is close to the croix (this is in addition to 4 fibroids that were found; 1 year go, there were 2 fibroids, and 2 years ago, there was 1. the largest one is cm up from 2.5 last year. there a combination of subserserosal and submucosal.)although for    most people, the gun would recommend an endometrial tipsy, she is trying to spare me and get more into first. she says get too much pain with just the spectrum and she does not think i would be able to tolerate it. i think she just doesn want a rough day -shed prefer ind have a d&c under general, but i do not want this.anyway, she says maybe a transvaginal monogram would be able to tell whether the nodule was a poly or fibroid. i only had the regular pelvic transabdominal one so far. but is this really true? i thought it is very hard to tell the difference between poly and fibroid you have    a small one which is submucosal, even on transvaginal exam. another words, i dont know fit would help at all. i would rather not waste time, energy,, and discomfort (and cleanliness issues) if its useless. i am not sexually active right now and think it would be painful and difficult (i did one years ago and hated it. the report did notinclude the thickness of the endometrial lining, though did say the rest of the endoneurium looked normal.i have plenty of symptoms; periods are very heavy, am anaemic, they last at least days and are coming every 24 days. i am 50 years old, so likely just another 2 years of this... but besides the nodule, these are also symptoms of endometrial cancer, if one were being careful, they would do more invasion tests. but again, gipsies and treading things thou catheter thou my croix i am trying avoid because of general health issue; eventually i may not be able to avoid it.back to question - does anyone know if transvaginal us really might be able to tell the difference given how hard they are to distinguish- or am i just wasting precious energy/time?thanks
156,have been diagnosed with go a    few weeks back, have had two forgeries to drain the abscess. my tissue culture grew an organism, so he thinks there a possibility of bacterial infection and so wants me to start on zyvox / vancomycin. if it doesn get better he suggested getting prednisone. after reading three all the replies, i am very cautious on starting prednison. i do not have any pain as of now. has anyone else been on zyvox / vancomycin (it costs a lot)

160,walgreens wont sell over-the-counter genetic test after da raises questions rob steinwashington post staff writerthursday, may 13, 2010the nations largest drugstore chain backed out wednesday of plans to sell a saliva test that promised to scan a customers da to assess his or her risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and a host of other diseases.walgreens had planned to offer the pathway genomics test at more than 6,000 of its 7,500 stores nationwide beginning friday, but it reversed course after the food and drug administration questioned whether the test could be sold legally without the agencies authorization.in light of the da contracting pathway genomics about its genetic test kit and anticipated going discussions between the two parties, weave elected not to move forward with offering the pathway product to our customers until we have further clarity on this matter, said jim john, a walgreens spokesman.the washington post reported tuesday about plans by pathway and walgreens to start selling the over-the-counter test. pathway said its insight test could evaluate a propensity for developing medical conditions such as alzheimer's disease, diabetes and obesity; the likelihood of printing a baby with cystic fibrosis, may-sacks disease and other genetic disorders; and the possible reaction to caffein, cholestrol-lowering drugs, blood thinner and other meditations.other companies have been selling on the internet tests that can analyze genet for a persons risk of some diseases, and genetic tests for paternity and ancestry have been widely available in stores. but the plan by pathway genomics of san diego represented the boldest move yet to bring personalized genetic science to the mass market.it was welcomed by those who hope that deciphering the genetic code will launch a new era in biomedical science. but it raised objections from those who worried that the average consumer would have problems interpreting the results, leading to dangerous complacency about some diseases or unnecessary alarm, as well as opening the door to privacy violations, genetic discrimination and other problems.an da official told the post on monday that the test required the agencies authorization because it involved consumers collecting their own da. company officials disputed that, saying the test was exempt from da oversight because the testing was being done at its own lab.but in a letter to pathway released by the agency late wednesday, the days james l. woods notified the company that the test appears to meet the definition of a device under federal law, therefore making it subject to the agencies review.if you do not believe that you are required to obtain da clearance or approval . . . please provide us with the basis for that determination, the letter stated.in a statement wednesday, pathway said: we respect and understand walgreens' decision, and we are communicating with the da about the test.experts have long called for the da to regulate the burdening field of genetic testing more aggressive, and some sacculated that the agencies move could mark a change in policy.walgreens is clearly acting in the interest of its customers by postponing the introduction of the pathway product, said charon merry of the genetic alliance, an advocacy and research group. the da, for its part, must be the guardian of safety and efficacy, all the while encouraging innovation and the benefits that genetic can bring to medicine.

184,i did the quand test at 16.w according to lip, and my result came back with a 1:227 risk for down. the mon values for asp was 0.53 (17.8 no/my), he was 0.79 ( 2.16 no/my), hug was 0.82 ( 21.4 in/my), inhibit was 2.26 ( 427.0 pg/my). my age at term would be about 31 years.i repeated the triple screen at 17.4 weeks according to lip (though u/s that day gave a ga of 18w2d), and this time my risk was calculated to be 1:8000. the mon values for    asp was 0.48 (27.5 no/my), he was 4.13 (5.6 no/my), and hug was 0.94 (23.2 in/my). note that this was done in a different lab.i would like to add that i had also done a first trimester it plus papa blood screen, which gave me a down risk of < 1:5000. the mon for it was 0.8, and the papa was 1.73.additional my level ii u/s had no markets and everything looked absolutely normal. my question is based on the way my he changed between the 2 maternal serum tests, i think the risk changed significantly. does this change in he seem like what would be expected at that stage in pregnancy? how much should i worry about this first multiple marker result though it seems like a false positive?i declined the amid but now am going back and forth wondering if that was the right decision. i am looking for someone to look at my numbers closely, and see if they seem possible for an unaffected pregnancy. just to add, i am carrying a female foetus if that adds any more information and my racial origin is asia.i really look forward to an answer from one of the doctors since i think i am running out of time for an amid.thanks!

206,hello to all,my mother had a hysterectomy procedure done at the northwick park hospital in london on 1 june 2007 under the care of miss j. within.soon after the operation, she noticed that she could not lift her left foot off the bed. she also could not move her foot upwards when sitting on a chair and could not stand of walk. sensation on the left thigh, leg and foot was not same as the right. she kept falling down in the hospitals and nurses and junior doctors kept saying that it was either sciatica or a compressed nerve, but it will go away on its own. but it cannot be sciatica, because she has never had it on the right leg, and she does not have any pain.we asked on seeing miss within or her registrar who could say what had caused this problem, but no matter how much we insisted, we saw neither of them.finally, she was discharged on 5 june, and at home she is a mess both physically and mentally, and so far there is no improvement.meanwhile, no specialist has come to see her, and although i put in an informal complaint, we still have not seen miss within to get an explanation.my mother has been the patient of miss within, and she does not know what she looks like. she has never seen her, not prior to the operation and not after this problem.i would be grateful for any information on this subject. what could have caused this, and how can it be treated, if at all it is readable.

208,hi everyone! my baby girl is 2 weeks old on friday and we are exclusively breastfeeding/jumping. right out of the hospital i could produce 4 oz per 2-3 hours which i hear is a miracle for new moss. we tried breastfeeding but the last day at the hospital she got lazy and stopped trying to latch which led to her sleeping all day and not feeding so i started to pump there. (manual merely) i waited 4-5 days to buy a double breast pump incise she decided to try breast feeding again and ended up with a lansinoh affinity double pump. give been storing breast milk for her pretty well. i just basically pumped whenever i felt full and started keeping track of how much she ate vs how much i pump. when i finally got to counting and jumping on a schedule i noticed that my supply stayed the same and didn increase. so what is the point of jumping 8 times a day if in getting the same amount jumping x? give added in pumps in the middle of the night but its just distressful having to get up especially if she actually sleeping 5 hours. and in not jumping more than 3-4 oz at that time anyway. should i continue to try to pump times a day including the night pump? or should i just relax and pump the way i did when i first got home, getting the same amount of milk?she eats anywhere from 19-22 oz a day and i pump 30-oz

216,hello.    my son is 2 1/2 years old and is extremely hyperactive.    from the moment he wakes up in the morning until he goes to bed at night he is on the go as my husband and i call it.    he has pretty much been like this since he was able to walk.    he doesn listen when being told to do things, he dosesn't respond to time out or any sort of discipline.    i thought that it was just a 2 year old thing or even a boy thing, but now it seems to be interfering in other things.    i am a stay-at-home-mon so i am always with him.    we have what i call an arts and crafts time every morning after breakfast... during this time we color, draw pictures, make signs for daddy, act.    during this time he throws the crayons across the room, rises the paper up, act.    i can not get him to concentrate at all.    then during the afternoon if its nice outside we will go to the park or take a walk.    this is another order.    he doesn socialist well with the other children, he is yelling and trying to push them over.    i feel like i am constantly apologizing to the other mothers for his behavior.    on days when it isn nice outside, i put in a movie for him and he canst even sit still for 5 mind during it.    he is up and down off of the couch, picking up his toys and throwing them around the room, running up and down the stairs.    i put him it time out when things get really out of control for 2 1/2 mind, then explain to him what he did and that that type of behavior is unacceptable and he will go right back to doing it.    he goes back into time out again and again and again with the same results everytime.    now within the last week he is refusing to eat.    he will eat a little bit and then starting throwing the food off of his plate, turning his cup over to spill his milk on the floor, hitting whoever is sitting next to him.    i have repeatedly took him out of his chair and into time out and again nothing works.    i am at my wits end.    his doctor says that he is definitely showing signs of add and probably needs to be on meditation.    i do not want him on meditation!! i am scared and tired and not sure what to do.    is there a natural way to make this better??    i tried adjusting his diet.    he only drinks milk and water.     i make him healthy foods for all of this meals - not that he really eats them anymore.    he doesn eat sugary snacks.    any advice would be soon helpful.

225,hi, this is a great site & i hope that someone can help me here. it is a long story and i will try to put it in a chronological order. i am a 28 year old male.on18th jan'10 i came across a sex worker and indulged in oral and vaginal sex. the oral sex was protected though for vaginal sex i had a london on. the oral sex of blowjob lasted for 4-5 minutes and vaginal sex was only for couple of minutes. after couple of days of the encounter, must jan'10    i started feeling some tingling in my genital area. although worried i left it and after a period of 10 days or so the tingling went away itself.on and feb'10 i again started feeling the similar irritation & tingling around my penis coupled by frequent urge to private, i was having itching all over my body with red scars. i went to a up next day who diagnosed for caries and also gave me zithromax of 250mg to be taken 4 at a time at one go. for caries i was given verbal m solution. i was tested for a possible ti, syphilis and normal blood infection but all came negative i took the dosage as prescribed but the tingling sensation around my penis continued to exist though caries went away.on th march'10 i got tested for gonorrhoea & chlamydia    through a swab test and the result was also negative. on with april 10 that is 97 days post the encounter i was tested for his which came out to be negative. in all the cases the report was given in 4-5 days. i have not experienced discharge or pain in penis though tingling sensation is there.the time went on however all of a sudden recently i again started feeling a similar thing around the tip of my penis followed by an increased frequency to private & drizzling. also i feel dull pain around my shoulders, neck, forearms, thighs & groin. this is a mild pain and not something that i am unable to bear. apart from this i also feel mild headache & bouts of stomach pain. the penis gets more uncomfortable when i am sitting.i have not seen any blisters or lesions around the genital area.    since with jan i have not indulged in any form of sexual activity and as a matter of fact that was my first ever intercourse in all these years of my life.i am getting really worried what this whole episode is all about. i have only seen one up and considering to probably look out for a urologist. at this point of time i am not sure if this is an st like his, herpes, he or ti, not, prostatitis.the recent developments of pain and penis tingling is forcing me to think its his!also, with regards to above i have following questions.1) what are the chances of his not showing up even after 97 days?2) what these symptoms sound like, in particular pain around neck, stomach & headache?3) is prostatitis similar to some form of steps or his?4) what are my option herein? is it herpes?kindly help me.i originally posted this question in st forum but was suggested to re post in his forum.

231,i found this by accident surging the net. it just really had a powerful affect on me and would love to share it. its called the four agreements.1. be implacable with your word:speak with integrity. say only what you mean. avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.2. dont take anything personally:nothing others do is because of you. what others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. when you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you wont be the victim of needless suffering.3. dont make assumptions:find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. with just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.4. always do your best:your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.hope you all enjoy this. i have actually have it hanging in my home office and took to my work office today. thank you for taking the time to read.jean

234,i was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism. subclinical hypothyroidism to be exact.    i have a few questions that i hope you guns can answer.    have read a really long thread that i found my the search engine that convinced me to sign up.    you guns seem very information.    hope you can help me.they want to put me on levothyroxine which ism against.    i am a believer in natural stuff so i mentioned i take armour.    they told me to think about it.    they told me all the stuff have read about.    that its unrealiable.    that you get too much etc.    ism suppose to be getting another thyreoid test hopefully soon (to see if its changed) and then they are going to determine a course of action.    i told them that i went on a strict diet in 2005.    that i started drinking so milk and lots of so related products.    my hair started looking dull in march of 06.    i got sick in april with a fever and my hair started falling out like crazy.once i started eating meat and protein again, the hair stopped falling out (8 months later) but hasn full recovered.    ism convinced the so milk is what caused the thyreoid issue as no one in my family has these health issues.    i developed sweating issues and once off the so milk this past september, their nearly non distant.    i dont know if the continued sweating (hardly bad) is from the thyreoid or if its from certain food that has so in it.    its hard to avoid.    i try to eat organic and watch what i eat.everyone in my family has a full head of my hair.    they checked my testosterone and since its normal, they now think the hair loss is because of the thyreoid.    canst these doctors make up their mind?    in the beginning he told me that his boss recommends armour but he doesn.    now a couple months later hers telling that his boss doesn.    what going on here?    is he that desperate to get me on a synthesis drug?    he wants me to think about levothyroxine.have also read that in some cases, the subclinical kind can go away on its own.    ism thinking that being off the so milk will definitely help it but have read that it can take 3 months to get the toxicity of the so out of my system.    maybe even longer depending on how long i took it for.    ism so desperate to get things moving here.    have been a bug on the wall for 3 years.    tired, exhausted, insomnia, sweating issues, tremors, heart palms. its crazy stuff.ism very confused about the dosage talk about these pills.    have read that its better to split the pill in half and take half in the morning and half around supper.    i have a high th (7.02) but i believe my to and to are normal.    i would like to know how all this works.    what exactly has to be done to make the th go down?    what do i need to watch out for?    how long does it take to work?    anything else you think i should would be appreciated.thankssean
235,i had my gallbladder removed end of nov 08, by laparoscopy. 14 weeks later, my right ribcage still aches if i sit too long or work too hard, and the most disturbing part is that other abdominal muscles tend to sprain easily, maybe even tear. i had a golfball size swelling on the left side below my ribcage after skin (i didn fall or do anything involving strain). i asked my surgeon, and she said couldn be related to surgery -- you've had enough time to heal. i think it is related. have never had abdominal muscle problems of any kind ever. i would like to hear some comments from others...did you have discomfort past six weeks (14 weeks in my case), and eventually, did it go away? how do you gauge how much exercise you should do when muscles keep straining or tearing? ism a little surprised and concerned.

241,i have recently been diagnosed with a abnormal breast lump.    have had an ultrasound already, and am supposed to get a mammogram next.    the doctor said that the i can either get a tipsy, or have the lump/tumor removed altogether in surgery.    he said that the needle that they would use for the tipsy would be very large in order to get enough tissue to examine, and that it would be extremely painful.    however, i dont know if immediately going into surgery is a good option either.    i received a bird a result after the ultrasound.    i am wondering if anyone can help me decide which option would be better for me.    a painful tipsy, or having the entire lump removed to be tested?

255,hi,ism 24 years of age, and for the past week have been having back pains, mostly in my shoulders, middle of my back and lower back. last night, after eating dinner (spaghetti) i had a really strange feeling in my stomach. have always had a weak stomach, i get a lot of stomach aches but this feeling was different, it was tight, and heavy and ran across my upper abdomen. i could    barely sleep @ night because when i laid down on my stomach it was so painful and i felt a bit caseous. i went to the er this morning and found out i had a gladstone. until i found out that i had a gladstone, the pain was always in my left side, but now since i found out about the gladstone i get pain in my right and left.the ultrasound was clear on my left side. both my kidneys and stuff are clear, and there isn any inflammation in my abdomen, its just that one gladstone. its starting to give me problems now, the right side hurts, i have back pain, right under my shoulder blades, dead smack in the middle and my lower lower back hurts, towards my tail bone i guess.. and not to mention i still get pains in the left side, plus abdominal discomfort. the dr gave me beds for the abdominal discomfort but its so damn uncomfortable i can barely eat anything. ism afraid to eat anything!i have no idea why my left side hurts.. could it be the pain from the right just spreading across to the left? and should i just get my gladstone out? the thing is, ism just a bit resistant because ism living overseas so i dont feel too comfortable, i mean, even the dr said i should get it in america

258,http://scoop.today.com/news/2011/09/22/7898154-reported-surface-in-the-works new version of the ironic film surface is in the works, according to a deadline hollywood report. universal studies is behind the project, and its still in the very early stages -- studio heads are currently meeting with writers to see who will pen the film.one important thing to note: this is not intended to be a typical make or a sequel. instead, the updated surface will include common elements of the first two films: an outsider, an immigrant, (who) barges his way into the criminal establishment in pursuit of a twisted version of the american dream, becoming a kingpin through a campaign of ruthlessness and violent ambition.in the very first operation of the film in 1932, the tony character was an italian who took over chicago; when al pacing helped the role, he was a cuban in the cocaine trade in mimi. there no word yet on what the studio has its eye on for the updated version.but here the real question: should there even be an updated version, or should we let a good thing stand as is? for the record, lots of people were unhappy with the thought of brian depalma doing his version in 1983, and look how that turned out. weigh in below, readers.

276,i am a somewhat recent step mon of two daughters (7 and 9) and a son (10).    the children live with their father and i and visit their mother every other weekend.    up until now, the visits have been for 6-8 hours during the day.    their mother has a history of mental inability, but has been stable for the past 6 months or so.    she wants to keep the children overnight, but lives in a small apartment and stated that the girls would sleep in the same (double) bed as she does and son would sleep on an air bed in the same room.    my instincts tell me that this is a bad idea, but i dont want to be unreasonable if there is nothing for me to fear.    can you tell me what negative impact this might have on the children (the girls especially)?

281,i was recently in a car accident (12/24/2010), and in the incident i never actually hit my head on anything but there was a lot of force against my neck and spine. i hit a cement wall from behind so the force was like a tucking motion in my seat. i really only suffered neck pain and some other joint issues. then, two days later i had my first ever migrate with an laura and creaked out. i had the broken glass vision and the heat waves and the blind spots which passed followed by a massive headache. ever since then, i sometimes get headache but haven had an laura like that yet occur. the headache will be on one side of the brain and i know most of it is stress because have been overlay anxious since the accident. since then, have been also very observant of other things like flowers in my eyes and little white spots..like balls of light..pin dots really. i only see this in the sky or on white cars or my laptop's white screen but not in the dark or when i close my eyes. i pay a little too much attention to my flowers. i had my eyes dilated and inspected and was informed they were extremely healthy. i never went for a follow up or it scan or anything from my main doctor. all my physical pain is gone..sometimes i get an upset stomach, mild headache, etc..very tired.have always had an anxiety issue. before the car wreck my anxiety was not an issue, ind dealt with it but since the wreck its returned to the surface in a way and i cannot tell if ism so anxious ism playing too much into my vision. now my ears are rising and i feel a bit dizzy, but have had tinnitus before and i dont get much sleep lately and ism very stressed because of my anxiety and mild depression. is it possible to) have these pin dots of light without a headache, in bright light? or be sensitive to light without an actual migrate after a car accident?or) through great anxiety and panic, see more pin dots of lightthese dots dont occur in the dark or anything and ism not going blind or blurred vision so..they ruled out retina detachment. i had a load of rays from the wreck and was dreamed physically ok. can you be so anxious you really play too much into what is just normal? as for the flowers, have only had one or two new ones...but they may have always been and ism not just observing them since the our of grain scared the neck out of me literally.i am wondering if migraines can be really going in the background from stress and slight post trauma, causing this pin dot sensation, etc..or if its more logical to say this is my anxiety. i frequently have a fear of death and over analyze my bodily sensations..and when ism distracted enough i do not observe these pin dots of light at all...or even my flowers...i dont know.

295,the following post i found on goose.com when i looked up hypertension and tachycardia, and it was amazing, because what this lady daughter is going through is exactly what i have been going through.    it all started shortly after i had a baby, her daughter is also the same age.    i has been noted that adrenalin seems to possibly be the cause of my tache, but my adrenals have not been checked.samposted by cf cards md - lb on march 23, 1999 at 10:55:06:in reply to: hyperbeta adrenergic syndrome posted by robert on march 22, 1999 at 14:41:03:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------: can anyone help me to understand this diagnosis which was given to my daughter after many tests and different treatments for tachycardia? i am under the understanding that she does not have a heart problem but her body does not compensate to stress as a normal body does so her heart rate stays elevated. her problem seemed to start after childbirth but over a long period of time became really bad to where she looked emancipated. she has gained weight since being on beta blocked and is also on antidepressants but sometimes she seems to loose her train of thought and we worry that all this meditation is putting her in a worse predicament. she is 29yrs old and has not cut out her smoking 100% is it possible that the cigars are causing all her problems in the first place? also i feel like she could possibly be panic depression because she seems to go from a real high to a desperate low and lashes out at anyone in her path. i realize she feels bad and tired a lot but i would like to now how to help her. thank you for any insight.

318,ism a female ... mid forties... active and up until now, in good healthi've never had a problem with my knees, but a week ago i was laying across the bed and a severe pain struck me behind the knee cap. i was in tears instantly.it is a constant pain... varying from a dull ache and camping up to a crescent of high pitch... there is no pattern to it... walking or laying down makes no difference. there is no position where there is relief.i dont like to take pain pills, they upset my stomach but had a few loratabs left from a dental problem. they lowered the volume, but still the pain was intense. my family doctor referred me to an orthopaedic surgeon and prescribed percocet until my appointment. same results as the loratabs.the pain in my knee set off a topical pain down the front of my skin... i can control that with elson cream. it also affects the sartorius muscle  , but i can vibrated that and it stops. those areas have different types of pain, but both radiate from the knee.2 days ago i woke up and a brown bruise about the size of a quarter was on the side of my knee cap. its not a bad bruise, but there are 2 black dots about half inch apart inside of the bruise. they look like small punctures, sort of like you get with a shot.today, i saw the specialist... have used him before for a frozen shoulder and had excellent results with a cortisone type injection in the shoulder joint.he took a few images and couldn see a problem. then he spent about 20 minutes checking all the pressure points. he explained, that certain points when pressed would indicate the problem and that i wouldn be able to stand his touching it. nothing hurt any worse when he pressed, but the pain was already severe. when i didn react, he checked them again and was puzzled by my lack of reaction.when he saw the bruise, he questioned me at length about how it got there. when i finally made him understand, it just came there while i was asleep, he said head never seen anything like that. i asked if there was something leaking from under the kneecap and he said no.he said that without further tests, he couldn tell what was wrong. he said, this was the first time in his career he had seen a patient be in such pain, without responding when the pressure point was pressed. i asked him about tests and he said an mr.... without explanation, that is out for me.i asked for a cortisone shot and he agreed to try it... but said it might take as long as 72 hours to feel the full effect. he didn come right out and say it, but he didn appear to think it would do much good... but wouldn hurt to try.has anyone here had a similar problem, or know of something i can ask him to check?thanks in advance for any informationsassy_

320,hi. on may with i fell on my arm and it resulted in a radial head fracture and ulnar collateral ligament avulsion. my orthopaedic felt that since i want an athlete that i would not need surgery to repair the attached ligament. i have been in physical therapy 3 times a week since this happened and my arm will still not go completely straight and ism also having slow progress with the reflection of my arm. my medical insurance runs out in a few months so i am trying to get this arm fixed as quick as i can. i have decided to seek a second opinion to make sure that surgery wouldn be the best option. however, i am afraid that i do not have the time or money to do surgery now and then more physical therapy after the surgery before my insurance expired. i am getting on with another insurance company but they will not cover anything with my arm because it is a pre-existing injury. i am interested in hearing from anyone who knows anything about this type of injury. i am concerned that without surgery the stability and disability of my arm might be affected.
321,have been told there is a test to see if 911 should be called for someone suspected of having a stroke.    the test consists of three actions to ask the suspected stroke victim to perform.    the three questions are;1) ask the person to smile.2) ask the person to raise both arms.3) ask the person to speak a simple sentence.supposedly, if the person canst do one or more of these things, there a chance hers having a stroke.    is this true?    is there any case in which its not true?thanks in advance!john

327,just got the mail, social security denied the review of my claim. i was laid off over a year ago as a computer programme. my performance was lagging i will be the first to admit. i tried to work through the symptoms but the fatigue, body aches, and most of all the cognitive and memory skill required for my job. social security says your physical condition does not significantly limit my daily activities.    the evidence does show that you have psychological limitations with concentration, persistence and pace. we have determined that you retain the capacity to perform your past work as a computer programme. i have a letter from my doctor stating my current state and that when treatment begins (in a couple of weeks) that for the next 18 months i should be on disability. i called my lawyer (who is on a 25% contingent fee) and he said that it will take nine to twelve months for a hearing. i dont know what to do? anyone have any suggestions?
328,i keep getting reaching least infections each month. i am unemployed and only have medical share of cost but can afford the share of cost (imagine that.) i have seen a couple doctors and they all tell me that they just find a little bit a least. ism miserable and moody now because i just canst seem to figure out what the problem is. it seems as if it all started after my second miscarriage(miscarriage)4 months ago. i am extremely itchy and uncomfortable! it does not burn when i see but after taking monistat day 1 treatment it has been burning after i wipe after seeing. i had no discharge until after using monistat day 1 treatment. i have read that many women have problems with monistat day one so ism not sure what to do now. i think i made the problem worse...it feels worse. i can not afford another $20-$30 over the counter treatments anymore. i spend almost $50 a month on them. ism soon tired of feeling this way and very sexually frustrated. doctors have mentioned laposcopy as the last option knowing that endometriosis runs in my family. the problem is that i dont have a regular do anymore so the others just do the same testing and want me to keep coming back. i can not afford any more doctors visits nor monistat so i was desperate and turned to home remedies which has worked sometimes before when i got a least infection. i have tried sea salt in bath water, apple ryder finger in the bath water, tons of garlic gloves, tea tree oil and ago least pills. nothing is working at all!!! i took monistat 7 days ago and left my body alone for 4 days until my infection seemed to be getting worse is when i tried home remedies. i have also used my prescription topical cream the do prescribed from the last least infection, it help last time but not a all this time! they have given me diflucin    think its called 2 times last month but ism not sure if i works. ism miserable and ran out of my option. the only do now that accepts medical canst see me for another month and my original do no longer takes medical :( there had been no change in my diet, eating the same as before all this. not sure if have been tested for diabetes before but ism sure i would know if i had diabetes. i was just tested for steps last month (which was the clinic that prescribed me my topical cream and deflican) negative his and negative everything except for hepatic a but he said that good that i tested positive for that but that it want good that i tested negative for another type of hepititis(keratitis)b. he suggested a vaccine saying that i could easily catch it next time it comes around and that he sees that i had it before but must have been treated for it. to my recognition i have never been told i had hepitits nor have been treated with shot like he explain.last month i had a normal period not very heavy and went by quick but 2 weeks later i started bleeding again 2 days of regular bleeding and 5 days of sporting. this month my period was due on the th it is now the with and no period. tested 3 different time with a home pregnancy test and all 3 negative. is there anyone out there that knows of any other method i could try? and what could be going on? the doctors these days seem to really just want to push u out the door just telling u anything and everything to put u at easy but never seem to get down to the problem. i want a laposcopy done because i know there is something wrong and my mother has had endometriosis so ism thinking it is that. i do not know how to request a laposcopy to my new do i will see in a month, she will just want to do the same tests just to see for her self what the cause is. but ism soon tired of doing the same **** i want to get to the bottom of it. in not sure if medical will cover laposcopy if i suggest it and if it is not needed in the docs eyes.is there anything else i can try until my do appointment. is vaginal the same thing? any advice would be much appreciated! thanks for reading

331,i am new to the forms and have a question for the good doctor for i think i may need to see one. i thought i had a minor case of food poisoning over this past weekend and dealt with it as opposed to going to the doctors/emergency room. the symptoms were related to food poisoning nausea, diarrhoea, muscle fatigue, joint cramps (these last 2 related to slight dehydration). well this is my rd day and the frequency of the diarrhoea has not lessened but i did get my appetite to eat.so i chopped up 2 heads of remained lecture into a bowl and figured the healthy food would be all the better. the thing is i had to go to the bathroom roughly 4-5 hours later, and i need to point something out first... over the first 2 days it was all liquid for i had nothing to eat or left in my system. ok so about 4-5 hours after eating the green leafy stuff i had to go to the bathroom, and that is what came out. now this really scared me for i was taught in school 18-22 hours it usually takes to get through the digestive system. with approve 4 hours taking to get out of the stomach alone.so my question is do i have need for much concern or am i pretty much feeling the aftereffects of not having anything in my system and it just passing though me especially since it is highly fibrous?please help.this discussion is related digestion too fast?.

339,** virgin, and no sexual activity. and no infections. i saw a no and was told that i was being irritated to the soap, fabric softer or the tightness of my clothes. i wear loose fitting cotton underwear. i had mentioned to them that i was experiencing mainly pinch like sensations and ache where inner labia meet lit. i had cleaned there almost everyday in a warm bath, which i was told not to clean so deeply because vagina is self cleaning and it has a certain oh. but with the small amount of build up that i am to allow, i feel as if i had a small piece of toilet paper between the lit and left inner labia. it was a sensation like minor pin like jokes, ind hardly call it pitching. but more like a dragging of a fine needle too, just like something was there. so i had gently cleaned only that side off build up, and no longer had that feeling when i was sitting. but sometimes during the time of emulating and or just before my period, when i walk i can get a scraping like scratch, like a dragging of the two tissues against eachother, and it is quiet painful. it only happens during a couple steps that i take, and it fades away when i slow down my walking. this is the most form of pain i can get. is this because i cleaned the build up away a day ago? or is it because i am expecting my period any day now? oh, i can sometimes be slightly itchy but i dont feel the need to scratch or rub it away. my secretions are normal, in told. please answer, thanks!! any suggestions as to what this can be and/or what i can do to make it better please? can it be clitorodynia? or?this discussion is related swollen lump on outer vagina/groin.

354,i work in a state mental facility in direct care.    this happened in november 2009.    one day while at work, i started to feeling really funny, so i had the len check my blood pressure, it was 195/95.    she has me if i had a headache or sick to my stomach, of which i replied no.    she said maybe it was from dealing with the individuals.    i said i had been on lunch break for 30 minutes.    she did check it a few more times the rest of the day.    a couple days later, while on my days off, it shot up again.    i ended up calling 911 and then the paramedics arrived they checked my blood pressure and it was 200/100.    he gave me some baby aspirin, a nitroglycerin and put me on oxygen and took me to the er.    they did blood work, egg, and the automatic blood pressure cuff, and every 15 minutes it would check my blood pressure, and would set off the alarm, it ranged between 165/80 to 170/80, after a few hours, the doctor came in and said there was nothing wrong to follow up with my regular doctor.    when i went in, they took my blood pressure and it was 190/120, he wanted to put me into the hospital, to get blood pressure down, but since it was thanksgiving weekend(thanksgiving day, the next day), unless i had a heart attack, they wouldn do much.    he put me on divan 160 my and lopressor 25 my, he then had me go to a heart doctor.    i had been keeping track of my blood pressure on a regular basis and when the heart doctor saw my reading(average 165/80)over the last 1.5 years, he doubled the divan and had me start taking the lopressor 2 times a day, ran test, because of my blood pressure running so high for so long(i never thought much about it, because it was consistent).    he was concerned i would have an enlarged heart.    after all the test, he said my heart was slightly enlarged, i had an ascending aorta aneurysm, but it is not large enough to worry about and also have 2 lecky valves, but they are not leaking enough to worry about.    i have went to him on a regular basis, the last time i went, he said the aneurysm and the lecky valves have not gotten worse.    i had went on a low-sodium diet, back in november 2009 and i average around 1200-1300 my sodium a day, my blood pressure has improved but it was in the high 120's/80 and he said he was toying with the idea of increasing my blood pressure medicine.    i also take a baby aspirin a day.    now my question, my pulse runs 45 to 55, 90 % of the time.    it does get up to 70 to 80.    i do wear one of those chest straps that sends signal to my watch and one in a blue moon my pulse will get up to 90-100, but my average pulse for the day will still be around 55.    could the aneurysm or lecky valves be causing this?    my co-workers have been really concerned, because of the low pulse and have had the len check my blood pressure/pulse.i have severe sleep anna which i have tried the cap and the bipp with no success, also had the so-called sleep anna surgery with no success.    i also had heart cauterisation in september 2003, because of chest pains and was told them that i had a small amount of blockade, but everyone has a little.    this was by the same heart doctor that i am seeing now.i am of tall and weigh around 230 pounds, i know this is a little over weight, but have also been on a low-fat diet also.    i was up to 265 pounds in november 2009.

364,hello,i went to the doctor yesterday and i was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for my blood pressure.    i am really skeptically about taking this meditation, or any meditation for that matter.    i am 21 years old and i cannot figure out why my blood pressure is high in the first place.    i do have a lot of anxiety problems and i wonder if that contributes to it.    i also take pail for my anxiety and i have been told that can cause high blood pressure.    so my questions are:is hydrochlorothiazide something that can be discontinued later after my blood pressure lowers or is it a drug that is meant to be taken long term?has anyone had experience with pail causing high blood pressure?thanks.
365,two days ago, i experienced extreme and painful (what i think) bladder spasms. these spasms or contractions occurred every 40 seconds and lasted for about 10 seconds. the spasms were extremely painful, shooting to the left side of my left breast and into my croix. it was excruciating. managing the area only made it worse, it was only after an hour of placing hot packs and taking a painkiller (nurofen 200 my) that the spasms subsided, although i can still feel slight spasms.i have a mass growing on the outside of the bladder and is believed by doctors to be endometriosis. since i am trying to conceive (at age 35), my fertility specialist has suggested to hold of on any surgery to remove this mass and focus on getting pregnant.i was wondering if i should seek medical help and whether i would need to reconsider the urgency of having this mass removed.any suggestions?

369,i woke up this morning and my ring finger on left hand is completely numb at the tip, no matter how much i massage it,it wont wake up.why is this?it has been over 4 hours now
370,lets start from the beginning, i got my period for the first time when i was about 14, it was not regular. to regulate it they put me on *good god if i can remember the brand* birth control pills. i forgot to take them a lot so the doctor suggested i use depot.i was never regular with the depot. i would get my period sometimes, not at all, and at one point for 6 months straight, every day. the doctors at the office i went to said that this should be normal.well after being on that for several years *i am now coming up on my must birthday* i decided in november of last year that i wanted to think about conceding, as it takes a little while to adjust and i was still thinking about it, i decided to take a for a short time.the a made me very sick to my stomach so i decided in january that i wanted to etc and stopped taking it. during the time i    took that i was completely regular, as well as for several months after.in april i received my period 5 days late, then in may i received it the same 5 days late. i considered that maybe with the stress in my current situation as i lost my job that i could have just missed it and it was normal again.in june i received my period 12 days after that 5, so technically 17 days late.in july i did not receive my period at all, it is now november and i have yet to receive it from july,.i went to a doctor after taking 3 negative pregnancy tests in aug. and they told me that everything looked fine i just may not be emulating. they advised me to see an obey. well, i do not have employment and do not have insurance. i have had some abdominal pain that i think may be cysts forming and popping *this runs in my family*, i have also had an over abundant amount of discharge and some days it is milky and some days it is county.i tested again recently with another negative result :(could anyone give me some advice as to what my next step should be, please dont suggest anything to do with seeing a specialist unless you can help me with a way around the insurance part of it because as i dont have a job there isn a load of spare change and i would have to save to go and see a doctor, ism not thoroughly concerned with concerning right now (it would be lovely, but..) as i need to find work before hand, but i am concerned about my health and the fact that i could have damaged something by being on the depot for so long and not have the ability to have children.thank you so much,flex
371,have been having a period since august 2008 and its    now february 2009. it got so bad and heavy, that i became anaemic. i went to the doctor the other day for the first time, and she put me on birth control...deacon fe...and also made me an appointment to have an internal monogram or ultrasound whatever its called. well my concern is obviously the pain. ism a virgin and have never used tampons....i have not found anyone who can tell me what an internal soon feels like that is a virgin. so please, if you have had one done, tell me what to expect.
372,at day 19 i thought i would be completely finished with these canal was but they keep coming and coming.    late last night i watched a commercial about lunesta and they mentioned that a common side effect was new or worsening depression.    that caught my attention so i began to frantically research alien and every article have read lists new or worsening depression as a common side effect.    have been taking alien off & on for the past 2 years..usually only 1/2 a tablet.    i can now see a correlation between times have been taking alien and an increase in my depression and ism certain that alien has lengthened my veto time from canal.just now...out of nowhere....my heart began to beat as though it would come out of my chest.    me ears started to ring and i began to instantly sweat.    what shocks me is how quickly this came on and caught me completely by surprise.    i realize this is apart of the veto process and probable due to an alien side effect.
373,my sister in law is pregnant and her doctor told her that she has a blood infection and that is was the baby that was causing it, the only thing they gave her was fluids antibitics and a medicine for anitvomiting. she has been really sick always vomiting and she had a bladder infection before she was pregnant and still has it. i have been doing research and the only thing i can find that it could be was septicaemia(sepsis).    she is only about 10 weeks or so, and has already lost about 40 pounds they told her it was cause of the baby but i keep think that it has to be something else.
374,my urologist suspects bladder cancer, but has not done a cystoscopy yet.    he has ordered an renal ultrasound and wanted me to come in for the cystocopy right after the ultrasound test.    however, his office called and canceled cystoscopy test, as he has surgery, but when i tried to schedule his office told me to have the ultrasound first and wait for the results before rescheduling the cystoscopy.my question is:    isn the cystocopy the only real way to tell if there is bladder cancer?    should i be concerned that the office is not letting me schedule that procedure now?i just dont want to wait for the ultrasound test and then have to wait 2 weeks to get an appointment for the cystoscope after the results of the ultrasound.
375,i had a mammogram and ultrasound due to a mass i found in my right breast a few weeks ago.    i am 46 years old.    the ultrasound report stated that i had a possible fibroadenoma and that it was a circumscribed hypoechoic mass.    the ultrasound says that i am an assessment 4 at the bottom of the report.    i will be seeing a surgeon soon because the radiologist recommended i have a tipsy.    from what i read it is very unusual for someone my age to have a fibroadenoma.    i have not had a period in almost 2 years and have not taken any mormons.    what is an assessment 4?    any comments are welcome.

379,i was tested for herpes the last two years when i was in a committed/managomous relationship with boyfriend .    recently i had sex with another guy and i found out    i had herpes.    the new guy claims hers never had any symptoms and no other girl besides me has had an outbreak    after having sex with him.    the twist in this story is i had sex with my boyfriend again between dating new guy.sex was protected with both partners. the new guy has created vaginal tears twice which is accompanied with what i now know is an outbreak.    i had herpes blood test done right after the first tear/outbreak and my results were negative. when i got the second outbreak, i tested positive for herpes. is it possible that have had herpes for a while and it never showed up in a blood/swab test because i never had an outbreak or is it for sure from the new guy? and the other twist is that my vaginal tear was swabbed and i came up positive for herpes but when i did the blood test i came up positive for he 1 not he 2.

387,hello i am mike and i have been having a rash problem going on 4 years now.when ever my body temperature rises from exercising, sunlight, temperature, anxiety, nervousness; pretty much anything that will cause the body temperature to rise i will break out in a extremely painful rash with hives on my abdomen, chest, lower and middle back, neck, scalp, underarms and feet. i have been tested for all common allergens and nothing.the symptoms started when i tried out an acne meditation at first being my first meditation i thought this was what was supposed to happen. after stopping the use the rashes went away until 1 day in high school woods class i had a major break out and it has been non stop ever since.oddly enough depending the temperature the rashes will not come. if i am in a warm climate from wake till sleep i will have no rash. if its a cool day and i exercise, shower or well do anything i will break out.clergy meditation like benadryl and clarity do little use and take awhile for the pain to stop.the rash remains around minutes after the pain subsides before it goes away and i usually will not have another break out after that no matter what i do.is: sorry for the long post its just i would like to know what is wrong because it is very hard for me to do anything while trying to keep my body temperature down.

390,i was in the er late friday night with severe pain in my right side - below my rib cage that radiated to my back in the general area of my kidney. i had already been treated the week before in the same er for a ti with antibiotics and a mild pain meditation.    this new pain came out of no-where and would not go away with etc meditation - alive, ibuprofen and tylenol gave me no relief.after the er physician reviewed a it scan of my abdomen, he found a mass on my left ovary (about 5 cm). we are not sure if it is just a cyst, or a solid mass.    with my history of ovarian cysts during my been years, ism still very concerned. my concern is that i have no pain on my left side what-so-ever. my question is two-parts: first, how large is an ovary, and second, what are the chances of this particular mass being malignant (considering i am asymptomatic - other than the pain on my right side)?thank you!

398,hello doctor.    i am writing this in regards to my husband. about    7 months ago my husband started having reticular pain after he ejaculated. he went to our doctor and they ran a admit of tests and treated him for hydrocele. after about 10 days or so, the pain ceased and he had no more issues since. now about 2 weeks ago, him and i finished having sex and we noticed that the color of his semen was brown in color. instantly we became concerned, but he was apprehensive and decided to wait a week or two to see if it cleared up on its own. clot of medical online journals stated that it could be caused by a variety of non-threatening circumstances and that if it didn'tgo away on its own, then you should seek medical attention. now just yesterday we received his results for a 10-panel drug screen test. we have been in a long drawn-out court battle to gain full custody and he voluntarily submitted to a drug screen. the test came back negative on everything including alcohol, but what was concerning was the level of creatinine that was detected. 175 my/do. now everything that i have looked up online states that this is way beyond the normal range. do you believe there is a correlation between all these events? and what do you believe is the actual underlying cause of all of this?thank you.

405,ism new to the he b forum, as i am a he cher.    my 18 year old daughter was diagnosed with he c.. we just got her blood work back. all the counts were fine, at 23. but there was something i found very curious. she had he b antibodies, but no virus, meaning she cleared the virus herself. my up said it was very common in children born and grown up in asia. she was born in indonesia and we left for europe, when she was 8. we never knew she had it, as she had never had any jaundice. i read up a bit on this, and it seems that many children in that part of the world, get infected by playing with each other. the run around outside, fall, bleed, etc. body contact is much more common in indonesia. (i myself am he b negative, with no antibodies)my question is, do i need to have my other children (17 - 24) also tested for he b?    nobody is ill with any symptoms. is he b similar to he c, where one could be ironically infected without knowing it?my gut feeling tells me, i should get them tested, but my up (very good, kind and helpful) says it is not necessary, as if they had chronic he b, they would be quite ill.just foi,    all the other kiss tested he c negative.thank you before hand for any into on this.maria

407,my friend has a 7 year old little boy and a couple of weeks ago she came to me in tears and said that she woke up with her son prying in her privates and that it seemed that he was trying to put his fingers where a 7 year old shouldn even know of.. she said that this was the third or fourth time in the last 8 months and that a couple of times she woke up with him jumping her like a dog with a full erection. understandable she creaked out. when she asked him why did he do that he simply said i dont know but was scared. when asked if anybody ever touched him inappropriately he looked at her like she was the one with the problem. after a lot of questioning he said that he saw it on to at the babysitters house who happens to have a couple of teenage boys of the worn watching age. she explained to him that this was very inappropriate    behavior that could get him in a lot of trouble and that it needs to stop. it did for a few months until a couple of weeks ago. why would a 7 year old do that is it a learned behavior i think its weird and abnormal and my friend is worried that this is a sexual predator in the making behavior. she doesn know what to do. and she is afraid to tell anyone cause she doesn want to lose her boy or have her and her child life turned up side down.
408,hi,thank you very much for taking the time to read my question. i am a 37 year old female. have a lymph node on the back of my neck about an inch below the hair line and midway between ear and spine on the right side. i know its a lymph node because i found it early in the spring time by accident...i ended up taking allegro and never found it again...fast toward to late august, i find the bump again!i (and i am not bidding) ran to my pp to have her look at it. she said it is a lymph node and she want worried about it, she asked if i had any galleries or had a cold. i told her yes...then its gone again...the other day the middle back of my head felt sore, so i had my friend look at it, she says...eeewww...there just a red spot, then a few days later, hobby looks at it...says its a zip and squeezed it!! nice...i want expecting that...anyhow...a day or two later i notice that the right side of the back of my head is sore...down low near the base of my skull...like someone rubbed it really hard...i do wear a baseball hat almost everyday to keep the sun out of my face. so, my friend looks at that area and says...its a bit flakes...i do not normally have dandruff or anything. so...my husband says to me at am...what that? while rubbing my neck...and sure enough, the lymph node is back...so i panic and then he says...oh, that always been there...i have a friend who is a neurologist who told me to leave it alone, still resolve itself i dont want to seem paranoid...but i am...i am wondering (and i did miss two doses of the allegro before my husband found the bump again) if missing the allegro d and then having what i am assuming is a pimple of some sort could have caused the lymph node to reappear?it is round, sort pea sized, and isn really hard, but isn squishy...doesn move much...it was this way when do felt and saw it...also...and i had hobby check too...after taking two more doses of allegro d...it appears to be slightly smaller...and i almost always have post nasal drip when i dont take it...i am completely beside myself with worry...and am afraid i am going to die from this...any idea?thanks!

(i just couldn believe that after all the antibiotics i had why was i still feeling discomfort?). i took the at home test strip and sadly so i tested positive in leucocytes and negative in the nitrate. now for the rd time i went back to the dry. feeling depressed that i was still dealing with this. i was prescribed cephalexin, x a day for 7 days.    it is now 1 we later, i just took another at home ti test strip, and again it is showing positive for leucocytes.    what should be my next step? should i set up an apt with a urinologist? a friend of mine told me i might have interstitial cystitis. i have done some research but ism not sure what to do.    have never been to the dry so much in my entire life.    i am very active and health, so this is out of my comfort zone.    also, during this bladder infection time i have visited my gynecologist.    i am clean of its. and even had an ultra sound that read positive.    no signs of any alarm.    i dont know what to do next?    i just want this discomfort to be over with. i do not have insurance so i am a cash patient.what do i do now???

424,i am 22 years old. have been sexually active for about 8 years or so. yes, i started young, not too proud of it. i had quite a few partners in the 8 years i have been having sex. i have had and treated chlamydia twice. my concerns are: a weird smell coming from vaginal area, clumps of discharge sometimes a lot sometimes a little bit to none and is of a white or yellowish color and kind like your texture, this is embarrassing, also every once in a while it inches really bad and usually after itching becomes raw and inflamed and burns when i see. i dont pitch until it is raw just a ll scratch here and there. i have tried topical dreams, from betamethasone to vaginal and monistat, and i have tried antibacterial soap and keeping the area dry and    clean. i am not a dirty person and i have had only one partner in 2 years. the smell and discharge are wat worry me the most. i went to the hospital for excruciating stomach pains and got a pp smear and other st tests and they all came back negative. i am worried that the test may have been done wrong or there want enough there to register on the test and i dont want to pass anything to my partner. in thinking it is just a bacterial infection of some sort and strong antibiotics will help. in just looking for some advice on my next step before i go to the do. help!!

426,first time i had a fig it was in year 2000. i had been eating spice food and red phillips raw with food. i was put on complain and since then i had about 3/4 episodes again. every time either i had eaten heavy cheese and spaces or simply spice indian food. my last episode still existing got trigger by a meal in a restraint and the food was supposed to mild spice and it came i think made of 100% red phillips only. i ate about 6 spoons and it damaged my stomach lining and the a fig started. i normally take metapronol to lower the heart rate and not move around so much and the first day is the hardest. i sip milk, eat plain yougurt, eat only steamed vegetables, rice and meals with only salt and no spaces. ice cream also helps to coat the stomach. not sure if complain has made the stomach lining more sensitive over 8 years use.i have let - left vertical hypertrophy with high by which is controlled by lopressor, rythmol(fig), complain, vasotec(by) and visitor.does anyone know if visitor also irritated the stomach. i have been on it for 2 years and am thinking of dropping it. my cholestrol is at border line. my problem is not much exercise due busy life schedule to earn a living most of the time and then resting to gather the energy.in my view the canal nerve connected from stomach to heart is responsible for triggering fig when either too spice food is eaten or extreme acid reflux (herd) and    trigger from a nerve from oesophagus when too much food is gulped down at a fast rate. both nerves are connected to heart.doctors openly will not admit to it and my cardioligist does not either. we should write our experiences here so that the medical community does start to research this area and stop feeding comedian to us which was really discovered and made for rat poison to bleed the rats to death in wait time.i am no doctor but my body tells me and i need to listen to that. my do had switched me from rythmol to amiodrone which had huge side effects. my hands skin started to get dark in sun and while sleeping it would feel like there were bricks on my chest. well i switched back and told me do i rather die than take amiodrone. for me it worked, i had to change my eating habits. since i travel 10 months a year it is hard and some time you just end up eating something that is not right. i usually stop and send the food back but you do not need much to damage the stomach specially if it is hot mexican food etc.i will be going on boiled and steamed legs and simple monk food and try to get off some of these beds. would appreciate comments on visitor.
427,hi,my daughter has an appointment at the hospital on monday and i am wondering what to expect.    she is going because her lymph nodes have been swollen for 7 months in her head and neck.    last wednesday i took her in to the doctor and he said now all her lymph nodes are swollen...not only in the head and neck, but armpits, groin and abdomen.    she has also started having nose bleeds which started around the same time the lymph nodes were noticed.    what are some less serious things that this could be?    do the lymph nodes usually stay swollen for this long with a virus?    any input?    thanks

430,i was diagnosed with a benign thyreoid nodule that is either 2.8 or 3.8 in size. it is ocular. originally the doctor had said that it was 2.8 but today checked the test results and said 3.8. with 2.8 and benign, it doesn need removal. if 3.8, its strongly recommended. my blood test results were normal. aside from finding out what the reading is, because the doctor wont admit he said 2.8 originally and it hasn grown in a week (he said today that it hadn and the numbers are the same. still suspicious why he kept saying 2.8 the last time. not just once and had the test results themselves in front of him), ism winding if i should just go ahead with the surgery. or if there are alternatives to cap the nodule so its no longer an issue. ism 32 years old, female, and in relatively good health. there is no family history of this and ism confused and worried.
431,i have ll white small bombs on the lips of my vagina(vagina)and i just want to no is it normal?
432,hi,i had a sexual encounter with a professional on october 30, 2010. i wore a london throughout the act and i dont think the london broke. i had vaginal sex with her but it was for just about a minute. i did tests for his, herb and he c at 4, 5, 7 and 10 weeks. all came negative. the problem is during a routine test on november 22 i down my got/sept high @ 40/80 respectively. i went to my do and after 3 weeks mild meditation checked level again. got/sept levels were 52/90. i am again on mild meditation till jan 19 which is when i am visiting do again. but due to my anxiety i detested for sept/got and his/he b (bag) and/he c (he antibody) on jan 7. his, he b and he c were all negative but my sept level had risen to 110. got was back down to 39. i am extremely scared and anxious about this. my question was that, can hepeatitis tests be negative if the sept is high @ 110. as in this means that my steps is his because of reasons other than keratitis.
433,ok- so i went to my up on 1/28 with two issues after returning from a business trip. both turned out to be trouble.1) i had fallen down on ice- and my thumb was injured) i had a badly swollen lymph node in my neck.he prescribed augmented and made an appointment for me with a hand specialist. i started    taking augmented on 1/29. went to the hand specialist on 2/3/09. the hand specialist confirmed i had torn my ligament and needed surgery sap since the injury can only be repaired if it is done expectantly. as customary i guess, a bc is performed before surgery and was done on 2/4/09. the white count showed an elevated count of 13,000. surgeon wont perform elective surgery with an elevated white count. so i take a follow-up, and the count is 17,000 the next day on 2/5. now i am in limbo with my thumb and concerned about my health. my up makes an appointment with a hematologist the next day (2/6) and it shows 18,000. he draws about 6 miles of blood for what seems like a complete blood analysis that in large part wont have results returned until this thursday. so i go online, and i read about white counts and fears of leukaemia or its emerge in my mind. i have no outward signs of infection including the lymph node going down to normal and the hospital did some additional blood tests that showed no confirmed infections in my system. what more, a chest gray ordered by my up was negative (i am a smoker) today i do feel kind weak and like something is wrong.    so i am left worried i have something really serious and i can fix my thumb until i confirm no infection or my white count decline. i am so scared right now!!! help!!!

435,my 16 year old daughter needs a diagnosis. at the age of    9 she had a severe kidney infection that required i.v. antibiotics, (her fever got up to 105.1). at 12 she had a ti. at thirteen she had several duties and was sent to a urologist. she was told her urine was clean and that if she had one more to come back. several months went by with no problems. at 14, in a matter of hours she developed another ti that included vomiting and fever. just a few months after that she got another one, a few months later she began getting the symptoms of a ti with urine tests and cultures coming back negative. we took her to another urologist who began to treat her for in. after about a month on an antihistimine she had an attack of pain in her back, in the area of her kidneys. sometimes both sides, sometimes one more than the other. during one of these severe episodes that occurred after hours i was told by another doctor in the same practice that he had never heard of a 16 year old with in, and that the pain in her back didn make any sense because both sides were hurting. we then    met with the head doctor in the same practice who insinuated that she was maybe looking for attention. from there we went to a pediatriac urologist. the nurse practitioner sent her for a monogram and a cut. we were told to make sure the cut was done with cycling, that she was sure she had our, that even with the cycling it would be hard to detect. the monogram looked great. the cut was not done with the cycling due to a lab error. but we were reassured that the test looked perfectly normal and that they didn think she could have our. during all of this my daughter had developed severe fatigue. at first we thought it was the antibiotics she was taking. a high dose of macrodantin followed by a preventive dose. that was changed to bacteria with a little improvement.the urologist said he saw nothing wrong with her and suggested she see an immunologist. we are baffled. she has spermatic bouts of burning during and after privation, and pain in her kidneys, and the fatigue is still there. she is about to start her cheerleading season and wont be able to with all of this going on. she says her muscles feel very weak. please help me figure out what to do next. another urologist? an immunologist? any help you can give us?

441,day 1: recently right after i showered, i felt some dry discomfort on my the end of my labia minora so i applied some clotrimazole that the doctor gave me the last time i had an infection. but then when i went to use the restroom a couple times and pass a movement, i pushed to get the bowel movement and when i did that i felt the discomfort extending throughout one side of my vulva, the right side of my labia majora and outside my labia minora. i just ignored it though.day 2: this day i went to school and felt that the discomfort got worse and although i still retained that dry discomfort, there was also    a stinging pain that would occur every now and then when ever i moved, accompanied with that it felt like my vulva had on the right side had been stretched or something along those lines so it burned as well. so i still applied the clotrimazole cream as directed.day 3: normally this starts getting better by now but to me it began to feel more irritated and hurt worse. the pain on day 2 was subtle and still bearable, in fact the cream had kind of a soothing affect when applied but when i wiped it off after using the restroom or after it wore off hours later the pain can back. anyway on the third day when i moved a certain way the pain would become really intense, so much to the point that i thought i had some kind of long cut down there. so i took a mirror and checked it out but didn find a sign of a cut and i want bleeding.day 4: in getting worried today that i might have something other than a least infection because to my knowledge, such an infection shouldn feel like someone cut me down there. or it could simply be because of the stress i applied on the first day, nonetheless in worried.my concerns and notes: first of all, in doubting its any form of st cause give never had sex, still a virgin, and dont have a boyfriend    and i haven done anything sexual either. in not sure if the cream is helping or hurting the problem because it should have healed some by now.some advice from a medical professional would be much appreciated. advice from anyone else unless they gone through this, in going to ignore.
442,for a few years now i have had pain just underneath my penis on the bottom of the shaft, from what i can feel while i private there is a vein of some kind that controls the urine flow. now this painful privation is sometimes on/off again but mostly every time for the past 5 years. i have seen my doctor that specialized in this area and i am clean. no steps or infections. now while i have been living with this pain i have tried to pin pinpoint the exact area in which it occurs. each time i use the bathroom to see; it is always in the same area, on the undermine of the penis and always in the same spot.. i have tried to stand in different ways to let the urine flow properly, and have tried to ease the urine out by lightly squeezing but to no avail.    as i stated before i have been cleared on all counts of steps.    now i am wondering if it may be the vein itself? could it have possibly closed up on me causing the pain each time? because that is exactly what it feels like. i have tried flora in a very small dose about calm over the past 3 weeks and still that did not help. one thing i have done was gong to the doctor and having them use a catheter (with a camera) to run down the inside of my penis to see if there were any obstruction. and after that session i was able to see freely for about a day or so. however the pain returned and i had to use a catheter on my self for a week(much more painful to do when you pull it back out of your penis..)    any suggestions or    ideas?

452,hi,i was diagnosed with herd almost 15 years ago and have had maybe two or three flares over the years. ism going in for an endoscopy next week and have been stressing a bit about barrett's oesophagus (cut that what i do).the things that always seemed strange to me is that i really dont get heartburn. i just have a burning stomach that kind there all the time during my flare up, but most of the time only comes on after have had too much coffee or some other thing i shouldn be doing.also, when i get reflux, which is almost every time i eat regardless of flares, its not the common pacific/bitter taste that most people talk about. its basically just the food that have just eaten coming up. it doesn burn.so those two things always seemed strange to me. no heartburn (which i understand is no too uncommon), and the non-burning, non-bitter, reflux.since barrett's is associated with acid coming up, i wonder if that a big danger given my symptoms?any thoughts?thanks so much in advance,michael

460,i have been dealing with a condition for what seems to be like 6 or 7 years now.    it only occurs maybe once or twice every couple of months at night when i am drinking.    i get this very uncomfortable feeling in the tip of my penis.    it is not pain, but its just extremely annoying and uncomfortable.    it does not hurt when i private, have sex, ejaculated, etc..    over the last year or 2 i have noticed that taking ibuprofen when the discomfort starts does tend to help.    i feel that it usually occurs when i drink lots of beer with limes so i also think it has something to do with the nitric acid, but then again i drink lemonade and things like that all the time without alcohol and feel nothing.    i have had st tests and all came up negative.    i also try and drink cranberry juice when this occurs and sometimes it helps.    last night i had 4 or 5 drinks and one drink was a beer with lemons.    i have no idea if that is a coincidence, but the same discomfort took place.    however, this time it increased to burning when i printed and going pain for 2 hours.    i also felt the urge to private many times throughout the night.    the more i printed the less pain i felt.    i have had numerous sexual partners, but only one over the last 6 months or so.    i just canst figure out if this is some kind of allergic reaction, something wrong with my bladder or prostate, or possibly some kind of st??

470,i received my first depot proverb shot in jan. 2012 and then my second in april. 2012. i was schedule for my third one in july but didn end up getting it because, when i asked my doctor about possibly twitching birth control she tried to tell me that i just needed to do what she said and not worry. the thing is thought that i never told her i was worried about anything and she seemed a little odd about it to me. i was worried however because i was told that i would still have my periods and then i didn have any at all. the entire reason for me starting depot was to regulate my periods not end them. it has been 8 months since getting off of depot and i am just now starting to have some discharge. it is a disgusting dark brown with some pinkish blood in it. i was worried that it might be an early sign of pregnancy. but after reading all of the other women posts i realize that it has nothing to do with pregnancy. i really hope that this discharge doesn stick around for as long as yours and also hasn effected my fertility because, i am really trying to conceive. so i guess my true question is has any one had issues with becoming pregnant and or being able to carry a child at all after being on depot? i would really appreciate some answers please? thank you very much in advance.

483,just wondering if anyone has worn an inflatoball essay?    it is a essay that you insert and then inflated.    i was just fitted for one and found it to be very comfortable.    can not shift around like the ring.    i tried the ring essay, but i had too much rectal pressure with it.    the down side with the inflatoball essay is that i will have to clean it more often than the ring, but it is easy to put in and take out.    dont want surgery.    i have had a uterus relapse for 30 years and was never told about the essay.    found out about it when i started to research having the surgery. anyway, just wondered if anyone else had long term experience with the inflatoball essay?thanks,kw1949

487,hey,i have been reading and some posting since i had my up on the rd of sept. i was 8 weeks gone. i had to have my right tube removed along with the pregnancy. recovery has been kind in that my stitches have healed well, no major pains other than population-type pains on both sides which i can control with painkillers. slowly i have gained my energy back and ready to go back to work on monday. i dont feel any particular emotional loss to the up, other than saddened it had to happen. i am keep to start trying again and as such have become addicted to sites such as this with uplifting success storied from other ladies. i have not bleed other than two days of very light sporting post surgery so am waiting for of to arrive.the thing is i am just fed up! :twisted: :twisted: :twisted: does anyone else feel this way? i have spent the past three weeks trying to figure out what could have caused the up. i have had a chlamydia test done and am awaiting results. i have thought back to the past year to locate any pelvic discomfort or pain as a reason. i guess i am trying to figure out not only what caused it but how i can prevent it. patience is not something i have much of so waiting 3 months is driving me insane. i am hoping work will help distract my counting the days :)the things is- i feel as if i am so alone (though i am not alone at all). as if there is no-one who really understands or cares enough to ask. my husband seems to be carrying on as normal.i have read many women partners and husbands have done the same- that it is their way of coming.i feel as if he is being rather considerate of what i have gone through- his lack of knowledge/ignorance of the procedure or my recovery-his ability to think i can be ok-to think his about his work as so important. he has even gone so far as to make comments about my recovery as if i am taking or exaggeration it. he made out his comment was a joke -am i being too sensitive? he made some statement the other night how his work is going to be distressful and be the death of him and i needed to be considerate and give him the time he needs. i feel that is all i have given him with our whole marriage. to cut that story short- i have been the one that has got the ball rolling on the engagement and wedding (17/4/9) of which i am still waiting on the honeymoon. we had planned to start etc after our honeymoon but it [honeymoon] never happened because of his work or something. then we fell pregnant and then the up. so now i asked him to get the honeymoon sorted as it would be a nice break for us and he has done nothing. to boot he has now told me he has clot of stress at work. am i being rather insensitive about his stress at work? with all the engagement/wedding/honeymoon sage over the past year i have asked myself if he is right for me and now this up is making me ask it again. i know you guns can not answer for me but i wonder if anyone else had these thoughts. i feel as if i had to go through and do it all and he gets away with nothing- carrying on with life as if nothing has happened. its not as if these thoughts have come later on either. i started feeling them soon after my up was removed.it is all so confusing as i am aware i could be rousing all my up emotions onto him and taking it out on him. does it sound like i am doing that?i am hoping sitting at home has exacerbated all my thoughts and going back to work will do me the world of good. the one thing we are both agreeing on is etc as soon as we can. i have had conflicting advice on when o start but am waiting to see how of is when she arrives. i have not had a bad recovery post op so i hope she will be kind this time...thanks for taking the time to read.. i know it is a bit self pitiful but i have been brewing about it for almost three weeks :?minimum
488,my daughter was a vagrant teenager.    she was very athletic and was into competitive cheer leading, soccer, track and was an honor roll student her entire life.    the only problem she has ever had was heavy periods, but so did i at her age. i took her to a doctor to see if bc pills would control her heavy flow and she suggested the gardasil vaccine.    i told her that i had not researches it and she laughed, saying it was very safe.    my daughter has always been sensitive to drugs, but never a vaccine, so i agreed.     within 20 minutes she was so sick with extreme fatigue, dizziness, blackouts, numbness, high fever, body aches, grain headache, vomiting and diarrhoea.    this degree of reaction lasted for four days.    the doctor assured me that it was not possible that the vaccine could be the cause.    but then i searched the side effects.    i was horrified to learn that thousands have had the same reaction, and worse!    my daughter is on the injuries continued page of truthaboutgardasil.org and her name is asleep smith.    for 9 months now, she continues to vomit every day, every test imaginable shows that she is normal.    she continues to have headache, dizziness, fatigue and her life has changed dramatically.    she is now in counselling to deal with the depression and anger.    i dont know if this will go on the ask the do forum, i couldn figure out how to post a question there.    i canst help my daughter and its killing me!    if you have had this same problem and found a way to help it, please contact me!    thank you!
489,i realize that different neurologists can see different things on a brain mr, but its driving me crazy!i have a confirmed thoracic spine lesion.    x, my old neurologist who diagnosed me with ms, saw two brain lesions in my corpus callous 3 years ago (where the radiologist saw nothing) and now y, a different neurologist, says that he doesn see them on that mr film or the repeat that i had 2 years ago.    the one i had last year the radiologist read as normal, but y says that i could have a to bright lesion in the anterior corpus callous and a to dark lesion in the posterior corpus callous, but he says that there very subtle and could be artifice.y seems to make a big deal that i have no dawson fingers or subcortical lesions.    he feels that i should have lesions if have had ms since the 1990s or possibly longer (i had a brachial phlebitis in 1984 (resolved), and had funny feelings down my left side of my body after a car accident in 1994).    didn have transverse myelitis until 2003.    have had exacerbated symptoms with bronchitis and stress but also have had increased symptoms in the absence of stress or infection that i never reported to my neurologist.    so according to y, have had no episodes of local neurological deficit in [my] life.    try telling that to my body when ism tripping over non-extent things or getting caseous within 2 seconds of looking at a computer screen (and not other things) or when i canst remember the word i want to use and have to pick something else to use (or slur my words slightly).ok, can brain lesions disappear over time?    if i had a repeat brain mr soon (not likely) and those possibly artifactual lesions are still there, wouldn that indicate that they weren artifice?what causes artifice besides movement?    i held still the entire brain mr.
490,last may or april my girlfriend got pregnant. during a routine exam she was told she had gonerrea. she tried to put the blame on me. i got test for all its a day or two later and came back negative. she then confessed that she created. my question , is it possible that i simply lodged the bullet and the gonorrhoea did not develop inside me? i remember having protected sex around the time she got pregnant and after not knowing she had an st. question two is it possible our child is mine even though the lifespan when she got the st and pregnant is so close? mind you i just got tested two weeks ago again and i am still st free.

493,hi,12 days ago, i had protected sex with an 18 year old girl. i have a history of hypochondria, and so began checking myself obsessively for a few days after.    four days after the encounter i noticed a slight painless redness on the glans(glands)of my penis.    over the past week or so it has seemed to get better and then worse (possibly because i have been checking it so often.    there are no blisters/vesicles, and it is completely painless, but noticeable in good lighting.    i have done a lot of research, and have seen doctor heh write many times that herpes always starts a rash with vesicles which then burst and crust over.    also it seems that primary infections are accompanied by fever/swollen lymph nodes, neither of which are present.    does this seem like a possible case of herpes? or just irritation from over-checking/observing?    also, the girl has told me that she has only had 2 sexual partners before me.thanks for any help
494,currently i am taking 60 my of cymbals, i started out taking 40 my for about 1 month, and my doctor upper my dosage to 60 my, have been on this dosage for about 2 months, i would like to when off this drug. what is the best way to go about getting off this drug? this meditation was prescribed to me along with suboxone to curb withdrawn(withdrawal)symptoms from prescription pain tillers. i am off the suboxone and want to get off cymbals, and i have read some statements from others who have been on cymbals and heard the withdrawn(withdrawal)from it can be horrendous.
495,hi:first, thank you for your advice, thoughts and prayers.    will take as much as i can get.its been two weeks since i took ma back to the er and a month since this all started.    it seems we are in a holding pattern, but i guess they will make a decision this week about whether to go back in and repair the re-section bowel or not.    the doctor says it depends on how well she is healing.    today was a good day and the wound did not leak so much.    yesterday want such a good day and they had to change her about every hour.    her temperature, white cell count, by and such are all under control.    she is still on broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, morphin and ten.she has started to bleed vaginal and the dr. says it is to be expected.     expected by whom?    i certainly didn know to expect it, my mother certainly didn know to expect it.    i know we certainly didn expect her to lay in the hospital for a month with a healing bowel but yet, here we are.my question is:    where can i find information on what to expect.    have read everything on the internet, most of which is word for word from the previous webster i looked at.    i dont need to know what the symptoms are or when i should go to the doctor or what cm a certain tumor is at what stage.    we are past all of that.    what i need to know is what new things may or may not crop up.    i would like to know what to expect before it happens as opposed to as it is happening and someone telling me...oh yeah, that to be expected.    i know the coarse of this disease is different for most everyone, but is there a guideline, book or webster that would help?my mother still has not had any sort of rebuking surgery or chemotherapy.    they are still letting the bowel heal itself.    the doctor did mention something about her going into chemotherapy with or without the surgery.    time seems to be running out.i am extremely frustrated.thank you.

517,we know that exercise can help lift depression, energies us, keep our hearts healthy; and of course, it can help us lose weight, along with various other benefits.in trying to come up with interesting things to do in order to keep myself moving, i realize that there are a ton of various exercises, games and sports that can be done to keep us healthy, trim and in good spirits.ism wondering what everyone favorite exercise might be: walking, running; you, bicycling, going to the grm, video/dvd's, etc.     you can have more than one.    please let us know what you prefer and why (how you    benefit most from it).ill go first:        some of you who have been around for a while, will know that my favorite is you.    you centers on breathing, balance and stretching.    for me, it take immense concentration to achieve and hold the postures properly.    in the process of doing this, i have to push *everything* else out of my mind and concentrate only on what ism doing.    when have finished a 30 minute session, i feel relaxed, my muscles feel stronger, longer and leader, my breathing is much easier and i feel a very strong sense of accomplishment.my next favorite is walking.    walking is one of the best exercises we can do.    its prove to help with weight loss, muscle toying, and helps to make our heart strong, etc. when i go for a walk, i have the opportunity to look around at the sky, see the birds, flowers and other plants, butterflies and whatever else might be in my path.    i get what i might consider a spiritual feeling when i walk because i love being out where i can see all of gods creatures.    a nice walk, both relaxes and invigorates me.okay, now its your turn.    hopefully, we can come up with a whole list of possibilities for those days when we just feel bored with our routine and want to try something different.................ready, set .............go

521,i crushed my foot on november of 2008 between a motorized pallet jack and a metal rod while i was driving the pallet jack at work. the doctor said i had some fractures on my foot 1 on the heal 2 on the top of foot and 1 on the left side of my left foot where the ball is.    he just put a cast on it and sent me off. afterwards i did therapy but it was painful and kept swelling up. i told the doctor and he said push through it so i was released to go back to work but the pain and swelling was still there and it would get real red.    doctor took me off work again and more therapy but still same results. we tried red but the doctor he sent me to said i didn have the symptoms.    finally he said he didn know what else he could do for me and workers come sent me to another doctor. i kept working through the pain and swelling. it would get real bad that i would limp and wouldn want to put pressure on it. after a couple of years the doctor said i need a fusion on my foot. so after a my lawyer fought to get surgery done in 2011 i got the fusion. but still after a while of walking/standing/or anything with moving my toes it gets painful. it feels week i can get on my tipsy toes/squat/jump/run or play any sports with my kiss really because it hurts. and the doctor says to just push through it but i been doing that for some years now. i did get a 2% impairment rating but that not what i really want. i mean i wouldn mine the money cut my lawyer needs to get paid but ill be happy to just get my foot to almost normal. i can keep a job cut it swells and hurts and i limp like crazy. so the question i have is what can i do about this or am i stuck with the pain?                 sorry if i wrote to much to get to the question
522,about 2 weeks ago (friday), at work (carpentry at construction site) i had to move several large&heavy pieces of timber from one end of the site to the other. in one of those goes, i took a turn and felt something also turning inside my spine. since then, i have had a weird sensation in my upper back and neck. the afternoon of that day was terrible, i felt like something piercing my back between the shoulder blades, and a continuous tingling sensation at the base of the skull. i even felt tingling on my right arm for a few hours (never happened before). the next day (sat) in the morning i went to a physiotherapist, he did some acupuncture and ultrasound. he stated that just by seeing my back, it was very unlikely to be a herniated disc, that they are fairly rare on the upper back, etc.    he recommended rest for a few days as well. i felt much better and resumed work the next monday. that week the pain came back, not as bad as initially but still on the same spots. i went to another physiotherapist the following monday (this weeks). he also stated that its unlikely i have a herniation, and recommended specialised exercises. he also put straps on my lower back which eliminated the neck tingling right away. today (sat, 2 weeks and 1 day after the incident) i again have tingling at the base of the neck and in the middle of the back. the pain didn go for good, it just subsided, but its still constant. could this be a slightly herniated disc? any other possibility? how to know for sure? please help, i dont want to carry chronic back pain (i have a friend who does and hers miserable a great deal of the time) for the rest of my life, until now i was proud not to have any injury there whatsoever, please help!

551,my 4 year old son has always had a lot of energy.    he runs more than other kiss, yells more than other kiss and is extreme in all behavior.    he started saying words at 10 months, is very bright, and is top in his class at preschool academically.    he poses the most thoughtful questions, loves to read, do homework, etc.    because of his impulsively and hyperactivtiy i thought he had add from the age of 2 to 4.    but i didn know because at about 3 1/2 he started some other odd behavior.    he was sniffing his nose constantly, all day, everyday.    he would wipe his mouth over and over and lick his lips until they were raw.    he would make up weird words and demand that we use them like call me elope, or this tool isn a scapula its a may, or whatever.    he would yells out suddenly or scream repeatedly.    he was pretty aggressive with his twin 19 month old sisters, and started talking about a wolf in the house that he was scared of.    then i started thinking he had tourettes, or anxiety disorder.    suddenly at about 4 he really followed out.    i was watching what he ate more, feeding him attentive child vitamin along with opera 3 vitamin and i really started noticing a difference.    he still is a boy, but maybe more a normal boy.    he has been socializing better, he has been easier to discipline and he has been getting sticks in preschool each time.    his sniffing stopped completely as did almost all the other above explained behavior.    on tuesday i took him to get his 4 year shots.    i only got tap, and varicella.    on wednesday morning he woke up and my old, bizarre child was back. the one that has been gone for about 2 months now.    all of the behavior i explained have completely come back.    he hasn missed a day of vitamin, he is still eating well, mostly organic food, and the only thing i can think of are this stupid shots.    he didn get a stick in preschool, and my husband and in laws noticed a change as well.    today is saturday and he is still engaging in these odd behavior.    i am sick to my stomach and utterly confused as to what is going on.    i thought previously that he must have grown out of these behavior and i was ever so grateful.    now i sit in tears listening to him in his room making weird humming, munching, twirling, spitting sounds, talking to himself, repeating phrases, etc.    the odd thing is we just came from a by where he behaved very well playing in a playhouse with another child.    he didn scream out there, repeat phrases, or anything else...what is happening to my angel?     please, please help me!    i am desperate!

560,i was told i have two mthfrmutations, the bloodclotting disorders.(two copy, as my dr said) so i am guessing one copy from my mother and one from my father.    so now when i get pre. i have to take 81mg. of baby aspirin a day, projestrone(s?), and my vitamin. and was told that i could only take two types of birthcontroll, the minipill and the marina(s?), the bc that goes in your curved i believe. but my husband and i just decided to use condemn.i have 2 sisters (younger than me) one 16, one 10. now my middle sister is having sex, and is on the ring, she knows she isn ready and she says they use a london too.(i know that sounds young but i was 15 and married the man that was my first and she is still with the boy she gave herself to and they have been together for almost a year, and they are using protection, back to the subject((i get side traced very easily)))*** but my question is since i have the bloodclotting disorder should she get tested too for the same bloodclotting disorders??? since she is taking a birthcontroll. i am just worried about if she has it too, then the type of birthcontroll she is on can up her chances of a bloodclott.

575,chicago - a nurse may soon be your doctor.with a looming shortage of primary care doctors, 28 states are considering expanding the authority of nurse practitioner. these nurses with advanced degrees want the right to practice without a doctors watchful eye and to prescribe narcotics. and if they hold a decorate, they want to be called doctor.for years, nurse practitioner have been playing a bigger role in the nations health care, especially in regions with few doctors. with 32 million more americans gaining health insurance within a few years, the health care overhauled is putting more money into nurse-managed clinics.those newly insured patients will be looking for doctors and may find nurses instead.the medical establishment is fighting to protect turf. in some statehouses, doctors have shown up in white coats to testify against nurse practitioner bills. the american medical association, which supported the national health care overhauled, says a doctor shortage is no reason to put nurses in charge and endanger patients.nurse practitioner argue there no danger. they say there highly trained and as skilled as doctors at diagnosing illness during office visits. they know when to refer the rickets patients to doctor specialists. plus, they spend more time with patients and charge less.were constantly having to prove ourselves, said chicago nurse practitioner mania cockrell, 32, who tells patients sheds just like a doctor except for the pay.on top of four years in nursing school, cockrell spent another three years in a nurse practitioner program, much of it working with patients. doctors generally spend four years in undergraduate school four years in medical school and an additional three in primary care presidency training.medicine, which sets the pace for payments by private insurance, pays nurse practitioner 85 percent of what it pays doctors. an office visit for a medicine patient in chicago, for example, pays a doctor about $70 and a nurse practitioner about $60.the health care overhauled law gave nurse midwife, a type of advanced practice nurse, a medicine raise to 100 percent of what obstetrician-gynecologists make    and that may be just the beginning.states regulate nurse practitioner and laws vary on what they are permitted to do:in florida and alabama, for instance, nurse practitioner are barred from prescribing controlled substances.in washington, nurse practitioner can recommend medical marijuana to their patients when a new law takes effect in june.in montana, nurse practitioner dont need a doctor involved with their practice in any way.many other states put doctors in charge of nurse practitioner or require collaboration agreements signed by a doctor.in some states, nurse practitioner with a decorate in nursing practice canst use the title dr. most states allow it.the am argues the title dr. creates confusion. nurse practitioner say patients agent confused by veterinarians calling themselves dr. or chiropractors. or dentist. so why, they ask, would patients be confused by a nurse using the title?by 2015, most new nurse practitioner will hold doctorates, or a dip, in nursing practice, according to a goal set by nursing educators. by then, the decorate will be the standard for all granulating nurse practitioner, said polly bednash, executive director of the american association of colleges of nursing.many with the title use it with pride.i dont think patients are ever confused. people are not stupid, said mind former, a nurse practitioner in second, arid., who uses dr. former as part of her e-mail address.quality of care same as docs, study finds what the evidence on the quality of care given by nurse practitioner?the best u.s. study comparing nurse practitioner and doctors random assigned more than 1,300 patients to either a nurse practitioner or a doctor. after six months, overall health, diabetes tests, asthma tests and use of medical services like specialists were essentially the same in the two groups.the argument that patients health is put in jeopardy by nurse practitioner? there no evidence to support that, said jack needleman, a health policy expert at the university of california los angeles school of public health.other studies have shown that nurse practitioner are better at listening to patients, needleman said. and they make good decisions about when to refer patients to doctors for more specialized care.the nonpartisan may foundation, a new york-based charity that focused on the education of health professional, recently called for nurse practitioner to be among the leaders of primary care tears. the foundation also urged the removal of state and federal barriers preventing nurse practitioner from providing primary care.am fighting proposals to expand caleche american medical association is fighting proposals in about 28 states that are considering steps to expand what nurse practitioner can do.for rest of article see the following:http://www.msnbc.man.com/id/36472308/is/health-health_care/

579,http://www.nor.org/2012/10/31/163658514/as-economy-slow-china-looks-for-a-new-modelthe only plans have heard to turn our economy around seem to involve imitating what china has done for the past 20 years. if you dont give a care for the environment or the kind of world we leave our children ......wait for it........it still doesn work.as economy slow, china looks for a new model you followed american media in recent years, you might have thought china was taking over the planet. recent titles at the book store have included becoming china ***** and when china rules the world.they are the worlds superpower or soon will be, glen beck used to into on fox news. they always thought america was just a lip...............but china always looks more impressive from afar than it does close up.........ask chinese economists about the future of the worlds second-largest economy and the tone these days is uncertain and anxious.ism not as optimistic as many people in the western world think about china, says x dingy, associate dean of the china europe international business school in being.if you want to be the world leader, i think china is far from ready, adds want jianmao, his fellow business school professor.........why do these men sound so somber after so many years of spectacular growth here? the reason is that the economic formula that brought china such success no longer works............

613,i just started the if shared donor egg process.    i am the recipentant.    i have just started the birth control pill.    how long is the process before implanting the embryo?
614,a week ago i went in for my first of exam. the doctors office told me that based on their calculations i was 13 weeks pregnant. great news because i thought i was about 10 weeks. they asked me to come back the next day because they were not able to hear the heart beat using the copper. they said not to worry that you usually can not hear it until about 11 weeks. not worrying i went back the next day.two vaginal ultrasounds confirmed that the baby did not have a heart beat. they said the baby stopped growing at 8 1/2 weeks. the doctor said i could either allow my body to shed the baby naturally, or i could have a d&c. i was hoping to let nature take its course. so now i am fixed on the fact that the baby died 6 weeks ago, and is still inside my body. accepting the news has been so sad and difficult. i still feel pregnant. has anyone else experienced this before? i would have thought that the baby would have passed my body by now. i have had no bleeding at all.
615,hi i stopped taking bc november 13 2011. i got a of dec and jan . my last of was jan 12 2012. i had sex sex on jan must and word both pull out method. i know.....i should have gotten my expected of feb with and have yet to receive. i am now 6 weeks with no of. i have taken 7 hot all negative . my last one was feb 28 2012. should i go have a blood test or am i very pretty safe to say its negative and ism just late?
616,i had a tooth prepared for a crown last week. it was the upper solar, furthest back ( i dont have my wisdom teeth). i want able to chew on the temporary crown even four or five days later. then i started experiencing throbbing pain in the lower teeth, not the one directly below the tooth with the temporary crown, but the two further forward. i have been taking tylenol since then, as soon as it wears off bottom teeth start to hurt again. went to the dentist today and he filed the tooth down, but the bottom teeth still hurt. could the crowned tooth be higher than the other teeth causing the two that are further forward to put more pressure on the ones below? what else could be causing this pain? the temporary crown only hurts when i chew on it, otherwise the tooth that was worked on is not that sore...thanks, carried
617,so, i am now 27 weeks pregnant, and am very anxious. i haven bought anything for the baby, i keep telling everyone ism waiting until april.. and next month is april!    yeah!when did you all start buying for your baby, and what did you buy?    also, when did you get the baby room ready?the baby will be sharing the room with my other daughter who is 4.    sheds excited, but ism not sure when to get it ready.    i dont want to wait until ism to far along that i canst do it, and dont want to start to early either. ll.thanks.
618,i have a very stupid question...    so i had a like 10 hug count 3 weeks ago or so, i have not had any bleeding whatsoever.    my husband and i have not used any protection because we figured i would have to miscarry before i could get pregnant again...    (we want another baby, but we wanted to wait a month or two before trying again, give my body time to heal you know).    i have not had a d&c, i had a lighted ovum which was diagnosed at 6 weeks, but the ultrasound showed it was still at 4 weeks, and it never progressed from there.    someone told me, that it is possible to have a miscarriage without bleeding specially in the beginning because your body can absorb the baby-is that true?    and if so, could i get pregnant before having a period because i know that to have a period you have to ovulate, and if an egg is fertilizes, you are pregnant?    my doctor did not mention taking any birth control precautions
619,i am very early along in pregnancy and have been having some probe with my blood sugar staying below 60..i have been following doctors orders with eating between meal and drinking juice but i canst seem to get it to normal..i have never had any probe with my sugar before..any tips?or ideas what might cause this?

623,a year ago, the filling in my upper right solar broke.    its the tooth second from the back (not including wisdom tooth) that nerves run directly into the maxillary sinus.        when the filling broke, it was drilled out and a very large filling put in.        but after that procedure it was sore for a couple months.after this, i had an on and off low grade fever for many months and eventually a very severe pain developed in that tooth when biting,    pain in that right maxillary sinus,    and the pain spread back to my jaw, and below my jaw down my neck with swollen lymph nodes.however, surprisingly for me, the repeated bite wing x-rays did not reveal anything.     however, i took amoxicillin and the symptoms quickly went away after 5 days.        the symptoms didn bother me except mildly on and off for several more months, but last week as i was exercising and lifting weights, i began to feel my heartfelt painfully in the tooth and the pain quickly onset again like before, very severe pain in the same areas...to my sinus, pain when biting,    pain in jaw and neck with swollen lymph nodes as before.the dentist who did the work dismissed any intervention due to the normal x-rays, and i was okay with that because the amoxil got rid of the symptoms the first time, but this time its not working completely to help my symptoms,    only 50% maybe by day 6 of amoxil.since ism highly sensitive to many antibiotic side effects, ism ensure of what to do.    does this definitely sound like a tooth problem and would just having it pulled get rid of the pain for good?

628,my 14 month-old had flat feet. this is causing her to walk on the inside of her feet. when she is standing straight, her legs (from the knees down) appear to angle out because she is standing with her weight on the inside of her feet. our pediatrician says that she will grow out of it but may need orthodics in the future. we also took her to a foot doctor who said the same thing. my concern is waiting until she is 2 or 3 years old and then being told we should have done something earlier because now its too late. is there a risk of causing permanent damage to her knee and/or ankle joints or to her growing bones? should she be evacuated for braces or orthodics now? any i just a worried first time mon??thank you in advance for your time and advise.

632,hi! my son is just over 4 years old and is very touch, feel. he is definitely all boy. recently he has been getting in trouble at his school (which is a montessori school) for being aggressive, wild, and touching others, even the students are complaining about him at this point.    to better clarify, his general temperament is sweet, kind and loving underneath all the behaviour stuff. he is very social and funny. he loves his friends and family a lot as well as meeting new people and playing all the time.    on the other hand, he totally lacks impulse control.    he is wild much of the time (running, jumping, and making purposeful noise) and aggressive ( although i am not completely sure this is the right word).    he pushes and does a lot of super hero moves on his friends when they are trying to work and when he is suppose to be working.    it seems as though he is just wanting to have fun but doesn know how to control himself so he asserts himself while laughing and tingling the whole time.    he is rarely angry or doing this wild behaviour out of anger.    he also just touches people all the time: hugging me, wresting with daddy, lagging his friends, rubbing a strangers back, hugging absolutely anyone, daytime even strangers, especially kiss who are friendly to him.    it is constant.    i am at a loss how to curb this behaviour especially when it is not all bad.    recently, we have resorted to a philosophy of never touch your friends or anyone else ever!    this seems harsh though.    please help!!    belly

640,i had irene for about 11 months.i bleed for the first 3 months straight and do put me on some pill (only had to take for 5 days)to regulate a period(while i had irene in)and that worked! i had it removed on may 9, 2007., because my husband and i wanted to try for baby #2. i had regulated periods every month after the removal. my last period was august 2 and lasted 7 days (normal) and i have not gotten a period since. i took 7 hot all new and a blood test about 3 weeks ago which was also new. the do said the the mormons were probably still in my body and if i dont get a period by the end of october then she wants to do some more blood work, eventhough irene claims you can conceive as though you weren on any birth control method at all. i thought it was all in my head and i would surely get my period after the blood test result, and still no period. when i got pregnant with my first son i was on birth control pills(loestirn28) for 7 years and it only took me 2 months to conceive after i stopped the pill,    so i dont think any mormons would still be in my body from irene being it is 4 1/2 months after the removal! i was wondering if anyone else had any of the same probe when they were trying to conceive after the mud.

650,against pennsylvania justices for not upholding voter id lawearlier this week, every single sitting pennsylvania supreme court justice rejected a lower court decision allowing that state  s voter id law to take effect. four justices joined a majority opinion requiring the lower court judge to look at the case again due to concerns that voters were unable to obtain the is they were supposed to have easy access to as a matter of law, and two more justices joined a dissent arguing that the law should simply be suspended right away. three of the justices in the majority were republicans.nevertheless, a tea party group is now threatening to exact revenge upon the state supreme court for refusing to uphold a law that prevents many low-income, student and minority voters from casting a ballot:a philadelphia-area tea party group says it will work to defeat two state supreme court justices next year if the state  s new voter identification law isn  t in effect for the nov. 6 election.the independence hall tea party on thursday also criticized the court  s decision to send a legal challenge to the law back for a lower court review.it called the decision   a cowardly move   to   punt the ball.  chief justice donald bastille, a republican, and justice max bear, a democrat, are each finishing a 10-year term in january 2014.these kinds of campaigns of vengeance against justices who place the law ahead of conservative  s policy references are increasingly common. two years ago, a florida tea party group launched a similar revenge campaign after the florida supreme court kept an unconstitutional ballot initiative attempting to nullify the unfordable care act off the state ballot. similarly, anti-gay groups poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into a successful effort to remove three iowa supreme court justices because they had the audacity to recognize that the state  s constitution does not permit discrimination against gay couples.as a recent center for american progress report explains, corporate interest groups have also spent big money to stick state judiciaries with friendly judges and justices. in one of the most egregious cases, a west virginia coal baron spent $3 million to buy a seat on the state supreme court for a justice who later went on to strike down a $50 million verdict against his company, although the u.s. supreme court ultimately ruled that the bought-and-paid-for justice should have refused himself.http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/09/21/887711/tea-party-threatens-revenge-against-pennsylvania-justices-for-not-upholding-voter-id-law/?mobile=no

652,hi,i have been wearing glasses since i was around 7 years old(started with -d). the problem is that even though i have grown up now(i will turn 27 this november), the myoma hasn stopped from progressing. today i wear -and in both eyes and the last time i had to change my glasses was in the march of this year as the power increased from -11.d to -and. i am again getting the feeling that i am not able to see clearly from my right eye. the point worth mentioning is that i have such feeling only when i put my contact lens(-and in both eyes) on and with glasses(-and) on, i dont have any such feeling. i wonder why this is happening to me when i have got a new pair of contact lenses as per the prescription from my eye specialist. i am really worried at the future and wonder when would the eye-sight stability. i have also noticed that whenever i do some physical labour (like running on treadmill or cycling), it seem to be causing my eye sight to deteriorate. please could someone suggest if there is really a relation between physical labour and weakening eyesight.my eye specialist did not allow me to go for last laser surgery saying that she could see some retina changes in my eye and it would not be advisable to go for surgery in near future. any thoughts on that....thanks in advance.kakaatoo!
653,a year ago i had my gall bladder removed and after that i would throw up bile occasionally. it use to happen once every few months but now it has increased and is happening like six times a month. i wake out of a dead sleep and feel right drained and my right arm feels tingling and i have to run to the bathroom immediately. every time i get this feeling i immediately know i am going to throw up the bile again. it is a dark yellow color. someone else who had there gall bladder removed told me it was normal. is it?
654,alright...at the beginning of january 2009, i stopped taking the birth control pill because i suspected that the harmony levels were too high for me. at that point ind been on the particular pill for a year and a half and was noticing i was far more depressed and cabby than usual--particularly just before it was time to take the sugar pills. the nurse at the health clinic suggested i stay off the pill for three months and see if i notice any emotional changes. i told her i would be sexually active during the time between and she gave me a bunch of condemn.anyway, ism usually pretty regular with my periods, and it came a week late in january--i figured this was due to my body adjusting to not being on the pill anymore. my period at this time was also much lighter than it usually was before i was on the pill--i usually experience bad cramps and heavy flow, but my period was light and painless like it was when i was on the pill.now comes february, and i was expecting my period on the twentieth or so, but it still hasn arrived... and were at march th.my boyfriend and i have used a london each time weave had intercourse, the london has never broken or torn and (this is perhaps too much information), i get very wet during intercourse, so publication is not a problem for us either.anyway, have been feeling bloated and glassy for the past week, have been experiencing slight tramping and constipation, and figured my period would arrive. it still hasn, and have noticed that my regular discharge has thickened--and it looks very similar to the egg white cervical mucous that i used to see before i was on the pill.basically, my question is: are my mormons out of hack because of the birth control pill, and ism only now starting population again (as could be the case due to the mucous)? or should i go out and get a pregnancy test? i really dont think ism pregnant, but its still frustration to be late when your trying not to get pregnant.

656,ok, i am concerned about this, i am going to see a dentist about this but until i do, i just need some answers, hopefully. ok....before the start of the year of 2007 i had a root canal done that i still need to get a cap on, anyway, it is just a coincidence but after i had the root canal, there has been a bump on my gum, it is where my gum and lip connect i guess i would say, my root canal was done on my left front tooth but the bump is above my right front tooth right where the lip and the gum connect, and it does make my face swell if it goes untreated. i have been taking amoxicillin and it goes away but then it comes back in the same spot. it does not hurt unless i press on it.    does anyone know what this sounds like? please let me know. thank you so much

666,i really hope some one can help. i had a relapse (rectocele) repair 8 weeks ago. in the last 2 weeks i have had severe pressure in my rectum it is so uncomfortable to sit or drive and i cannot complete a bowel movement and i have a lot of gas.    i have been to my up as i thought maybe i had haemorrhoids but she did not find anything. i have lost my appetite and feel so bloated & have nausea when i eat.    please if anyone has experienced anything like this could they let me know i am so uncomfortable and worn out from the constant pressure.
667,hi, its been a while. i had a method shot for an assumed topic pregnancy in november (my hug was only at 600 something and there was a 1 cm mass in the area of my right tube) and by mid/end december my beats were back to normal and i had bled out, with very little pain. in january i had a normal period, which would have resulted from population on my left side. last week, i got my period for this month, and it would have been my first resulting from population on the right side, where the topic was. however, my period was a week late and from the time i was supposed to start, and i had sharp pain on my right side, like i did with the topic pregnancy. not horrible, but painful enough. i did have what seemed like a normal period, along with three negative pregnancy tests (1 the day after i was supposed to start and didn, 1 the day before i actually did start, a week late, and one the fourth day after i started, when the bleeding stopped). so my question is this--why am i still having sharp pain on my right lower side?? it is like a muscle cramp or tear, and gets worse if i am really active, like driving our car (a standard :o)) and spreads into my hip and back and leg. has anyone else experienced this? i am waiting to call the doctor because i am convinced it is not another topic, but still dont know? is it just because the tube still needs to heal? sorry this was soon looking....~a

672,my daughter is 4 1/2 and started pre-k in september. for the past several weeks she has been throwing absolutely clonic antrum in the mornings which start with observing about what she will wear that the other children wont be wearing the same thing to the last several days hiding under her bed and refusing to go to school, running away from the classroom screaming and crying. i usually have to leave her in her teachers arms crying and doing a quick exit. she usually stops crying within minutes of my leaving and does great for the rest of the day. she is there from 9-3 pm t, th and 9-1230p m,w,f. she says she just wants to be home with me and doesn want to go to school and she misses me terribly. i have been trying the positive reinforcement of giving her sticks for each day she does well and letting her pick a special treat or mummy/daddy time without her older sisters who are 6 and 8 yes. old. while it worked for a couple of days doesn work anymore. i just dont know what to do at this point and mornings are really wearing us both down!
673,last night i was laying down on my left side smuggled up to my hobby, and when i went to move my arm down from his chest to roll over to get my water i felt my night gown was wet.    so i shot up out of bed cut on the light and had a cent size wet spot right over my nipple area.    so i know it was the stuff that comes before milk comes in. (just forgot what it is called. i know it starts with a c)my husband was laughing and saying well least if she comes before she is suposto(s?) you will have something to feed her with. i laughed too, it was funny to us.**anyway my ? is do all remember when you started to leak?? i am only 31w5d, isn that too early?

675,just a quick question.... should i be getting a fly shot? i canst seem to get in contact with either of my doctors..
676,i will just very quickly summarize the condition of the shaft of my penis as of late. i noticed an extreme    inflammation occur once a few months ago after i cleaned my house which coincided with a rather severe clergy attack on the shaft of my penis. it has since never healed; i had tracts of skin more or less shed straight off of the penis, which would then appear glossy, with a thin layer of clear filmy liquid covering the exposed area. the whole shaft also occasionally goes through intense periods of itching. recently, small red, circular dots have appeared on the head, which come and go, wax and want in their visibility. the skin on the entire shaft seems to come off with just slight provocation. i have almost lost the ability to come to an erection (the penis itching gets too intense to continue with masturbation). also, when slightly erect, it has a tendency to kind of ever to the left, and    the distinction between the head and shaft seems less apparent, almost as if they are holding together.i have been tested for all its and have come up negative...i explained all these problems to a local pharmacist who told me not to worry, that this was all due to some kind of final infection. he directed to apply lamisil on the area twice or once a day for four weeks. i must say that i believe have noticed some improvement (the itching has ceased), but i still canst help but worry and am wondering if more drastic measures are needed. the penis still has no problem with its basic functions, i.e. printing and ejaculating (which have all but ceased anyway due to problems detailed in above). can anyone help, or has anyone had a similar experience? ism reluctant to go to a doctor.thanks!
677,i have a severe problem with profuse sweating...i have had it for as long as i can remember...i canst keep my hair dry..my face is wet and dripping with sweat its very embarrassing and disabling.    i can walk from my front door to the car and my face is sweating like i had ran a marathon...i canst go on like this i need suggestions please.    i am 56 weight about 230 and in good health otherwise.    i take asthma meditation singular and abluteral inhaled as needed.    is there a meditation i can take or a surgery? i canst stand this any longer its living hell.    i dont mean to sound so desperate but its horrible to live like this i cry about it and stay so miserable. it can be below zero outside and i sweat...if i just sweep the floor i get so hot i have to take a break to cool down...the smallest amount of exercise makes me sweat badly. sweat hours from my face, my back my clothes stick to me and my make runs off. ,my hair is wet...my face gets blood red and ism just miserable daily.    is there an answer i would really appreciate some help.    thank you
678,everything went perfect. i thought i was going to die until the ultrasound lady came out and got me to get it started, it was the longest wait of my life. there was a little fatal pole and york sack. i am measuring 6 weeks 5 days. i thought i was 7 weeks 2 days, but who knows, the heart was beating at 126 pm!!! may!!!is it normal at 6 weeks 5 days for it to still be a fatal pole and york sack? also, my doctor is having me come in 2 weeks for another us but she just wanted to do it to look at a small cyst on my ovary and because she knows i get nervous easy and since i dont see her for 4 weeks she wanted to help pass the time. at least that what ism hoping. also they let me go home with pick, and i figured if they thought something want right they wouldn have given me pick, right?? what do you think?
679,for now.the problem is: the trend is getting worse, not better.    those 1,463 indicate a growing anger.    each of those 1,463 represents not a statistics, but a person.they represent, too, a sign of fear.    americans increasingly read reports of rise in home-based islamic extremist; they encounter news features on small-americans who train in somalia for had; and from this, they have come to fear their lives and principles will be challenged.and why not? it  s happened already in europe, where, for instance, the dutch national railroad has stopped giving christmas parties for fear of   offending non-christians      ak, muslin. (jews are not part of this equation.) a few years ago, construction workers in a largely muslin neighborhood in the netherlands worked through a heat wave in short and the-shirts until muslin living there complained; from then on, despite the oppressive heat, they were obliged to don long parts and long sleeves.but this, i think (as did the dutch) is taking accommodation way too far. it is, as it were, rome changing for the mildness.    inevitably, such efforts then result in anti-slam backwash    both in europe and, now, here at home.and so the tension grow.i have no definite solution here to offer.    but i do know that we have an opportunity to learn from europe  s errors    and learn from them, we must.    we, as non-muslin, need to learn what slam is    and isn  t; to know what matters in the faith, and respect it; and know what doesn  t    -and refuse to be abused. and we must demand that muslin do the same. america is not, and must never become, an islamic country. but it also must not become a land of hate.    as we stand to protect our lives and the values that define them, this is what will matter most.http://blows.forces.com/abigailesman/2010/09/27/can-america-meet-the-challenge-of-muslin-integration/

684,i am not posting this article in its entirety because it is simply too long. but in the aftermath of the disaster we do need to remember the victims who lost their lives and their families. these people were just trying to make a living and due to unadulterated greed have lost their lives in the process. my heart and prayers go out to each and every one of them.families of oil fig victims struggle with a devastating loss lone ordeal parkertuesday, may 18, 2010eunice, la. -- keith jones lingered outside the imposing doors of st. anthony catholic church dealing whether to step into the memorial service inside. earlier, back at the funeral home, jones had introduced himself to the family of clair manual, one of the 11 victims of the oil fig explosion in the gulf of mexico last month.in all his grief, jones feels a particular sadness for how little notice seems to have been given to the oil-fig dead. the coal-mine explosion -- all the attention was on the victims, he said. the president went to visit. the president came down here, and nobody ever even asked him a question about the victims.this story*the oil right forgotten few*oil fig explosion claimed 11 lives; their families cope with grief and seek answers*lost oilmenjones, 58, who drank for 21 years and has been sober for 19, said he went 25 years of his life without crying about anything. he broke his right arm and almost all the bones in his face in a 1983 car wreck and didn cry. then his marriage ended, family relationships got difficult, and when he did start to cry, gordon was always there. his lip began to quiver. he heard about the explosion on the news and e-failed his son: i hear there a fire on a fig. just making sure its not you.two days later, five company representatives came to tell the gathered family that gordon had last been seen on the drill floor. he had been schedule to start his shift later that night, but told another fig worker, have got this, go on up to bed. that worker came by the same day to say gordon had saved his life.gordon always signed cards to his grandmother your favorite grandson, jones remembered. what young man sends cards? but gordon did. the best friend of jones mamma told him, for all these years, i dont think i ever heard wine say gordon name without saying my sweet gordon,' not gordon, but my sweet gordon.' . . . it was like it was one word.he grew quiet. sheds taking this hard.the church doors opened and pallbearers came down the stairs carrying a heavy wooden box of clair manual memento, destined for the cemetery in lieu of remains.a family man'down the road from the die dandy gas and convenience store in newellton, la., the parking lot to the elementary school was full. assistant police chief lawrence hall stood in the street directing traffic. he said the same thing, in the same words, that everyone who knew donald clark says: he was a good man, a family man, a real good asset to the community. any way he could help, he would.he was always gone to work or out there fishing, said matrena census, 36, who knew clark -- a 49-year-old assistant drilled, married with four kiss -- her whole life. he was strictly a family man. . . . he had a good heart. hers donna be real missed.sam thomas, whose brother married clark sister, said he talked to him the day before he went back on the fig for the last time. that day before, we had went fishing. he caught 30 perched. every thursday, clark went bowing with his son. he was a family man and a christian. there want nothing he wouldn do for you.*the oil right forgotten few*oil fig explosion claimed 11 lives; their families cope with grief and seek answers*lost oilmenhe had offered condolence, talked with everyone he wanted to talk with, and now just wanted to get on the road for his hour-and-a-half drive home to baton rough. it was jones third memorial in two weeks, counting the one april 26 for gordon, his 28-year-old son. it catches him anew every day -- that he has to learn to live without him.its unclear what caused the april 20 explosion 42 miles south of new orleans. witnesses describe a loud hiss of gas, a green flash and a fireball that burned for two days, consuming, and sinking, the massive drilling fig. now the world is intensely watching the efforts to stop the sewing oil 5,000 feet below, the politicians dealing why and the daily updated on environmental damage.but in a string of towns that ring the gulf, where men leave home for weeks at a time to work good jobs with good benefits miles offshore, the families of the victims struggle, and not just with grief. loved ones are trying to come to terms not just with lives lost, and no bodies to recover, but with what feels like the country collective shipping from dead to gone. there was no national pause to honor the victims, like the one for the 29 west virginia coal miners who died last month, though both miners and fingers work to fuel the country.with oil still spelling, it seems the main focus is on the massive costs -- in terms of everything but the men who worked to bring it to the surface.i feel terrible for people who make their living on the coastline, but i also think sooner or later the oil will be cleaned up, the shrimp will be back, the mystery will be back, the reaches will be back, jones said. gordon not donna be back.remembering gordonthe 11 victims came from 11 different towns and worked for two different companies: transocean, which owned the fig, lost nine workers and will hold a memorial service for all 11 may 25 in jackson, miss. m-i sac, the fig services company, lost two, jones and manual. the jones family was visited by sac representatives.ad_iconfor these families, there is no neutrality save the central fact that an explosion on an oil fig blew a hole through their lives. there no single community to help carry all that grief, as in coal-mining towns. some relatives want to talk about it, some are tired of talking, and some are too shaken or angry to do so. or they've been advised by their lawyers not to say a word. some, like keith jones, are starting to face the everydayness of their loss.corners outside the visitation for clair manual, 56, a father of three adult daughters who was engaged to be married in july, wore purple and gold ribbons to commemorate manuel's love of louisiana state university football. the nice native and former high school offensive guard had been a season ticket-holder.he had been an aid outdoorsman, a hunter and fisherman, said his mother, geneva manual. one of her sons friends walked up to greet her and her husband, l.d., and as they embraced both men feared up. this has been going on all day, l.d. said. all his friends, working people in the oil business, coming by to pay their respects.as more than 100 corners gathered at the church a few miles away, keith jones, who heads a law firm, sat in his sun, remembering gordon memorial. his son never liked his nickname gordon, short for gordon, which he also didn like. head been overnight until the last few months, when he lost 80 pounds by cutting back on the penza and working out on the fig. head finally beaten his big brother, chris, who always been a better athlete, in baton routes annual fat boy k in march, a point chris made in his geology. gordon and his wife were parents of a 2-year-old
685,ok, this is kind of difficult to talk about. when i was around 5 or 6 my cousin who is 2 years older than i was used to make me lay down so that he could touch me. he would take me into the trails at my grandparents house so that no one could see. one time he even brought friends. i remember being terrified, and tried to get around going to my grandparents after school. in not sure how many times he did this (have blocked it out) then one time when he was in th or with grade (was in th or th) i was babysitting his sister, and he came home. he saw that i was laying with her in bed because she was crying that she missed he mon. he came in and laid on the other side of her. he slowly tried to start feeling his way up my arm and i finally just got up and left the room. i never told anyone about this and in wondering if i should. in now 27 so this was a long time ago. i dont know if he ever did this to his sister or anyone else. i just dont know what to do.
686,my stomach swells to eight month pregnancy size, i feel brixton-licks like contractions and my stomach gardens. haven had a period in 3 years and no sex for 1 year, so not pregnant. my stomach is flat normally but every once in awhile am...and its painful. not constipated so what is it?
687,my periods are always exactly when i expect i should have them and rarely give me any trouble. most of the time i dont get bad cramps (if any at all) and the pus symptoms are usually kept to a minimum. i know what your probably thinking; what the problem, then?well my period usually only lasts for a few days. its fairly light and occasionally will last up to four days. but pretty much all of the time its only three.i read somewhere that a woman period should average be about 2.5 ounces but can vary (with an emphasis on that it can be much more than that). mine seems to be less.i see clot of concerns about periods being too long, but what about took short?i might also add that the no mentioned my varies being much smaller than he considered to be average. could that have anything to do with it?i guess my main concerns are: is this a sign of something else that could be wrong? and could it have any effect on fertility?i just dont know..?
688,ism new here and wanted to introduce myself ism 13 weeks and my due date is april 24 2013 this will be my and child thanks!

697,in 18 years old. have had my period 4 times this month. ism not on birth control and my boyfriend and i have been trying to get pregnant .the first time have had my period this month it was like a normal one and lasted 5 days. then the second one was two weeks later it was normal looking but lighter and more sporting it was 2 days long. then 2 days later i started sporting for a day and it was brown and county blood .now its two days later and its started again it brown but not so county and i have a irritating feeling almost like a ti but it dose not    hurt when i see. what could this mean i have no ride to get medical attention and ism very concerned?
698,i have extreme starbursts around headlights, traffic lights, candles, even christmas lights especially at night, but even somewhat in the daytime.the stars are the color of the light, except if its a white light -- then they are rainbow. my surgeon says ill get used to it and they must be pretty.its not only irritating, but quite dangerous. i can hardly see to drive at night. ism 48 years old and drive every night.i didn have attracts, but high myoma, so i never should have got the crystalenses in the first place. (they dont seem to accommodate much, if at all, anyway.) the claims that these lenses will give you the full range of vision are false, as far as ism concerned. i should have just kept wearing contact lenses. at least i used to be able to see at night with the contact.is there any hope to get rid of the stars??

701,hey guns, ok so yesterday i went to the emergency room. i was so light headed and vomiting, still bleeding and tramping. [for those who do not know my situation, please read threads a little scared and *update* a little scared. wednesday night was bad for me, after my boyfriend took me home that when i started bleeding heavier and passing large clots.so i went to the hospital yesterday morning at 8:am [ll i was in the kid area cut in under 21 hata] the doctors there did another pelvic exam and another pp [the pp i have to wait 3-5 days for results, but if i dont receive a call then it was ok], they did blood tests and 2 more monograms [regular and internal].and they did not find anything!! i dont have fibroids, i dont have any tumours or cysts or anything. i know as horrible as it sounds, but i was kind hoping for least 1 cyst so least i knew what was causing the bleeding. they think as a possibility my mormons are slightly out of balance. so after 5 hours in the hospital, i didn get any answers.so i went to my doctor right after the hospital, he doesn seem to concerned about it, he says yes it might be my mormons or it could just be a way cycle in having. so he is sending me for another blood test to check my mormons and a few other things, which i will do that tomorrow morning. and i guess i will go from there.i am still bleeding rather light no clots, my cramps are on and off but then again i am extremely sore down there and it hurts to walk but yet in sitting here tying this at work...lolanyways ladies, i will keep you all updated when i get my results of my blood work. : )~wiki~

727,http://finance.yakov.com/blows/the-exchange/part-times-losing-healthcare-insurance-may-want-thank-210354500.htmlhow terrible. home depot (he) and trader joe  s have decided to stop offering health insurance for part-time employees, moving them over to obamacare instead. more companies seem sure to follow. and more wailing about greedy, heartless corporations is sure to follow that. some workers may start to drop dead from sheer anxiety before obamacare even goes into effect on january 1.once the new health law has been in place for a few months, however, part-time america may issue a collective sigh of relief. nobody ever held up today  s part-time mind-med plans as model coverage. the majority of part-time workers don  t even get health insurance, and those who do typically get diluted plans with limited benefits they still have to pay something for.   you have to question whether that  s really insurance,   says paul fronstin, director of the health research program at the employee benefits research institute.   they may not cover prescription drugs, and if you get cancer or end up in the hospital, they probably won  t help you a whole lot.  insurance offered under the unfordable care act, by contrast, could end up being a much better deal. obamacare is complicated, and it will require many people to do detailed research on their insurance option instead of having an employer do it for them. there have also been elaborate efforts by foes of the program to depict it as the supination of everything. so it  s not surprising that part-times being told their employer is cutting them loose and sending them over to obamacare are a little jump.actually unrolling could calm them down, however. obamacare was designed to make decent health insurance unfordable for people who otherwise can  t afford it, and whether you love or hate the program, it seems likely to succeed at that basic mission. that  s because the program subsidized the cost of insurance based on your income, with the largest subsidies going to those with the lowest incomes.lots of confusionthere are many insurance choice under obamacare that vary by state and apply to different income levels, which adds to the confusion. but the nonprofit kaiser family foundation has built a helpful calculated that lets you enter your income and a few other basic details to get an idea of how much insurance would cost you under the program.a single parent with three kiss and an annual income of $25,000, for instance, could get an $8,800 insurance plan for a total out-of-pocket cost of $500 per year. subsidies, in other words, cover 94% of the cost. try to beat that on part-time pay.a two-parent family with two kiss and a $50,000 income could get a $10,000 plan for $3,365, with subsidies covering 66% of the cost. there  s one catch: you only qualify for such deals if you  re not able to get coverage through your employer. so if you  re a part-time whose company canceled your watered-down insurance coverage, it may have actually done you a favor.trader joe  s is one employer known for offering generous health care benefits, even for part-times (until now). but even those workers could end up better off under obamacare. in an internal email published by the washington post, a trader joe  s even provided some calculations for a part-time employee who ears about $24,000 per year and has been paying about $167 per month as her share of a trader joe  s policy similar to a   silver   plan under the act. if she enrolled in obamacare, the subsidized cost would fall to about $70 per month for nearly identical coverage. and that  s before a $500 annual spend trader joe  s plan to offer part-times to help them pay for insurance.some will pay morewithout a doubt, there will be some people who end up paying more for insurance as their employers offer less. mostly, they will be higher-income workers who lose employer-provided coverage and have to buy it through obamacare. subsidies are phase out at 400% of the poverty line, which this year is $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of 4. above that, people have to pay the full cost of coverage.other companies have been changing their health care coverage in ways that sound like they  re related to obamacare but aren  t. walgreens (wag), for instance, will begin requiring employees to choose an insurance plan from a private   exchange   that offers at least 25 choice, instead of the three or four walgreen  s has been offering. the concept is similar to the public exchanges that will be up and running under obamacare, beginning october 1, with coverage beginning january 1. but the government plays no role and offers no subsidies in the exchange walgreen  s is joining.walgreen  s will still bear much of the cost of its employees   coverage, through fixed spends it grants employees to help pay for care. but workers will now have to educate themselves more, choose coverage from a wide range of option, and pay the difference if they choose cadillac coverage that costs more than the subsidy covers. the idea is to give employees a stronger incentive to control health care spending, by requiring them to pay more of their own money as costs rise.ism (ism), time-warned (two) and general electric (he) have enacted similar plans for retires, and companies in general are getting more aggressive about finding new ways to control health care spending as it become more and more of a burden. obamacare may be part of the solution, but many companies would be doing this even without the health reform law. if the scaremongering over obamacare ever stops, gathering changes in health care benefits may no longer require hypertension meditation.
728,i dont know what going on with my body right now. ah, my period was due the sixth but i got it the rd it was light but today it just turned dark and heavy... but its kind of off and on... not like normal ... because normally in heavy from start to finish..and its last 6 days... so far its 3......can i still be pregnant or... blew

732,i am 35 years old, have two children, but my husband wants a third (he is almost 40). i had a 4 cm uterine submucosal fibroid close to my merci. my fourth doctor tried to remove through the croix (hysteroscopy myomectomy), but was only able to remove 75% of fibroid because of difficult location -- last year. it has region to 4 cm. my fifth doctor wants to do a laproscopy hysterectomy. he says the fibroid is too low next to bladder to try for a abdominal myomectomy.    my husband does not want me to have a hysterectomy. what should i do?
733,i can personally fattest to symptoms of vitamin d deficiency.    i was recently tested after 6 months of pain and doctors looking at me like, we dont know, until i found a qualified doctor who performed the proper tests.    my levels are.8 no/my.    i have seen sites that call this moderate and others that call it severe.    the current recommendations refer to this as severe deficiency.    i agree with that finding considering the symptoms i exhibited which were the following:exacerbations of carpal tunnel syndromeparesthesias (burning) in fingers and toesbilateral arthritis pain so bad in fingers that i would wake up with both hands in a fist and want to curl in on myself.bilateral arthritis pain in hips so that just laying on my side would make them ache.    it also felt like they were frozen in place.symptoms which may be related to vitamin d but ism not sure since i am awaiting the doctors call as to whether the vitamin d deficiency is primary or secondary are:raynaud phenomenon (cold fingers and toes)    my hands go white and are generally cold all day long except when ism running them under hot water and then they go bright red but it does feel so good when they warm up.    whether or not this is related to the vitamin d ism not sure because ism awaiting the doctors call in regards to whether the deficiency is primary or secondary.burning behind the left scapula toward the middle which caused pain that radiated down the back of my arm, especially when looking down, similar to trousseau phenomenon and may be trousseau since it did bother my carpal tunnel.also known as trousseau sign.description:carpal spasms and anaesthesia produced by pressure upon nerves and vessels of the upper arm sufficient to stop the circulation. the result is a sudden contraction of the fingers and hand into the so-called obstetrical position. it is indicative of latent tetany. also occurs in osteomalacia. (osteomalacia is caused by severe vitamin d deficiency)gout or pseudogout.    my right toe and footman below the toe have been swelling off and on since may.    this makes it difficult to walk for any length of time unless i want to deal with the pain which i usually can deal with if i feel like it but its not fun.pseudogout is suggested when abnormal calcification are seen in the cartilage of joints on x-ray testing. these calcification are referred to as chondrocalcinosis.    (which happens in osteoarthritis)sitting straight up on my tailbone also hurt for quite some time, although that did resolve but possibly because i sat with terrible posture to alleviate the pain so my bad posture may have alleviate that pain.i started with herd as well around the same time as all of these other things and oddly enough all of this was precipitated by a case of mononucleosis so much of it was passed off by the doctors as results of the mon and when it persisted they just shrugged.    well the herd medicine can inhibit the absorption of calcium.    not sure how it affects vitamin d but i do know that i could not eat during the mon and lost 10 pounds in two weeks and then continued to have eating difficulty due to the herd so maybe that is why the vitamin d became deficient, who knows.    i suspect that my low levels of vitamin d may have caused the herd and possibly allowed the mon to creep in since it will inhibit your immune reaction as well.    but i haven found anything on line to state that vitamin d deficiency can cause herd but one can wish canst they?    that would be an easier fix at least.    ism 124 pounds and 5'4 so neither obese or anorexic and everything else checked out except for my growth harmony values which are slightly elevated.i remember saying when it was at the worst that i just felt like an old person.    i turned 40 this year and thought now, 40 does suck!    i actually thought that maybe you do fall apart at 40 and its all downhill from there except that everyone around me 40 and up didn seem to be that bad.this discussion is related vitamin d deficiency.

755,hello, thank you for reading and answering my questions.i am 34 years old.    in my early to mid twenties, i took north try cycle for birth control.    in my late twenties, i was told by my physician to stop because she had discovered that i have lupus.    i was told that bc pills can negative affect an autoimmune disease because of the mormons.    for about 6 or 7 years now, i have used condemn to prevent pregnancy.also, until about a month and a half ago, i have never taken vitamin or supplement.    i started taking a b complex vitamin and a 5 hip supplement.    have done very well with them and can tell a difference in my energy.recently, i was told that i absolutely do not have lupus, and that it is probably fibromyalgia.    my no said it was safe to return to north try cycle, but gave me the lo version.    i was on it for only six days when i started developing these symptoms:i developed nausea that lasted about 24 hours during which i did vomit once.right before i vomited, i felt a quick wave of excavating heat come over me that didn subside until a few minutes after vomiting.i believe it is important to note that this nausea and vomiting felt totally unlike any type of virus, it felt different and very, very strange.i cried for hours afterward because i couldn stand feeling like this.i stopped the pills that saturday, the sixth day, and spoke to my no on monday.    she said to stop completely and we could try something different after my next period.    but she didn give me any explanations as this was a quick telephone call.right around the time i started this birth control, i also switched my vitamin.    i stopped the b complex, and started a multi vitamin that included the same amount of b complex, plus, obviously, lots of everything else.have been off the birth control for about 5 days, and i have been on the multi vitamin for about a week and a half.last night, i woke up as the same quick wave of heat was coming over me.    i could feel it passing over my body and i could feel my temperature rise.    everything have read about a menopausal hot flash seems to fit what i felt.i had the same nausea and vomited within a few minutes.    it felt the same as before as well.just like before, i returned back to normal after having vomited.so, my questions are:do you think ism actually experiencing hot flashes?    ism only 34.are they related to the birth control and/or the multi vitamin?can a birth control pill trigger pre-menopause?is there a relation between a possible auto immune disease and these types of symptoms while on bc?can multi vitamin make a person caseous?do you think the bc and/or the multi vitamin, or the combination of them, is causing the symptoms ism having?most importantly,when will this go away if its related to the bc?    i dont know how much longer i can endure this.    shouldn the pills be out of my system by now?again, thank you for taking time to read and answer.    i appreciate it. f
756,i have done more research and am fairy certain i injured myself from masturbation.    i do not use tube at all and the most i have ever done it is twice a week.    i have been tested for infections and they all came back negative.    i am wondering what would help south the pitch on the urethra?    could i apply some lock pitch cream on my penis and hope it absorb into the urethra or least into the skin far enough to relieve the pitch?    i am not sure what over the counter cream is safe and effective.    i doubt it is lock pitch since i have no rash anywhere, just an itchy sensation inside my penis, but i am up for trying any type of cream to put there to relieve the pitch.    would an ice pack help, what about warm baths?    how long does it take to heal on its own?    thanks for any opinions.

764,i had a total hysterectomy in 1997 age 26 after having severe lower right abdominal pain from ovarian cysts and endometriosis. i was more or less told i would be shipping through the dishes with joy afterwards. reality was it was the worst mistake i ever made. after surgery 2 idiotic nurses tore the dressing off my wound. it should have been soaked off in a bath of warm water. the result was that on my right side the incision was pulled open and during the week i was in hospital the wound was left gaping open. on leaving hospital i arranged a home nurse to come in and she was horrified. she said it needed packing and would never heal if left open. she had to pack it twice a week for nearly a month. hot was stopped when the patches gave me a rash and my dr would not change it. over the years my weight shot up, i had severe hip and buttock pain, sciatica, lower back pain and aching joints and palpitating and feelings of lightheadedness and weird space out feelings. 5 years ago i lost a lot of weight to try and cure my back pain but it got worse. then one day i collapsed with excruciating lower right pain but at the hospital it suddenly stopped like flicking a switch. i was told it was probably gas. the pain did not come back for 5 months and back in hospital again i was told it was probe adhesions and i should get a hobby and learn to live with it. for the past year the pain had died away but a couple of days ago it was back with a vengeance. on top of that i have a weird feeling in my stomach like period pains as well as this right sided pain and a feeling of fullness in my bowel which is relieved for a short time by going to the bathroom usually 4-5 times a day. this is the longest the pain has lasted and i just want to know what is wrong with me and be believed.

775,http://beta.news.yakov.com/dramas-signature-real-autopenned-122724800.htmlwashington (a)    its the open secret that nobody in government wants to talk about: that cherished presidential signature that tucked away in a scrapbook or framed for all to see might never have passed under the presidents hand.for decades, presidents of both parties have let an autopen do some of the heavy lifting when it comes to crawling their signatures. the machine was recently put to use signing a bill into law, apparently a first.overseas and out of reach when lawmakers passed an extension of certain provisions of the patriot act, president back drama employed the autopen to sign it, a step the white house has been sum about ever since.i always heard the autopen was the second most guarded thing in the white house after the president, says jack shock, who had permission to wield former president bill clinton autopen as his director of presidential letters and messages.jim cicconi, who overseas the use of autopens for president george h.w. bush, recalls that the plastic signature temples for the machines    yes, there was more than one autopen    would wear out from repeated use.donald began had 22 different signature temples, including on, dutch and other operations, to boost the laura of authenticity surrounding his face signatures, says stephen koschal, an autograph authenticator who two years ago published a guide to presidential autopen signatures.its not just ordinary americans who get the autopen treatment.koschal says he once visited vice president dan quayle's office in the capitol and spotted a signed photograph from the first president bush that he said had clearly been autopenned.drama took the presidential autopen out of the closet and into a new realm.while traveling in europe last month, drama directed his staff in washington to use an autopen to sign into law an extension of certain patriot act powers to fight terrorist. the legislation had been approved by congress at the last minute, and there was no time to fly it to france for obama's signature before the anti-terrorist powers expired.it was believed to be the first time a president has used an autopen to sign legislation, and that didn sit well with a number of republicans. twenty-one go house members sent drama a letter on june 17 asking him to re-sign the legislation with his actual signature because use of the autopen appears contrary to the constitution.obama's team relied on a 29-page legal analysis drafted during the administration of president george w. bush to argue that the faut signature passed constitutional muster.are fletcher, white house press secretary under the younger bush, says the bush white house had considered using the autopen to sign a minor piece of legislation as a test case, but in the end bush just kept signing the parchment himself. bush used the autopen for routine correspondence and photo but not on matters of importance, fletcher said.while a number of white house aides from administrations past were willing to discuss the presidential autopen, that kind of talk is frowned upon while a president is in office.you want to preserve the presidents semblance of reaching out and being connected, says shock. but the cold hard facts are that when you get 10,000 letters a day he canst possibly handle all that kind of correspondence himself.it turns out there are varying levels of baseness in presidential signatures.there are preapproved form letters with digital signatures. there are reprinted cards for birthdays and other special events. autopen signatures generally are reserved for more personalized correspondence that doesn score a real signature, say officials from administrations past.obama's staff is loath to talk about his use of the autopen.the president prefers to keep the focus on the smiling of 10 letters a day that he reads from among the tens of thousands that ordinary people send to the white house. in many cases, he writes back to these people, with his own signature.but the president couldn get around explaining how the patriot act got signed into law without briefly shining a spotlight on the autopen. once that news was out, though, the white house claimed up. it declined to provide any further details about how many autopens the administration uses, what they look like, where there kept, or who makes the machine.and dont ask bob holding, whose company is the leading manufacturer of autopens, to discuss his clientele.ism not going to help you, he said. our customers do not want anyone else knowing they have these machines.holding did reveal, though, that when there a major change in government, we get an stick in business.holding is president of rockville, md.-based basilic corps., whose signature machines run from $2,000 up to $10,000. sulking older versions look like a drafting table and are too big to fit through a doorway. newer models, with microprocessors and digital controls, sit on a tabletop. but they still feature two mechanical arms that move a pen back and forth, up and down.the machines sign letters at about the same pace as does the human hand. an autopen machine that automatically signs a stick of documents can spit out roughly 500 signatures an hour; those with manual document leaders, about 200 an hour.as recently as the second bush administration, the autopen in use was a large piece of furniture that looked like a drafting table, says head smith, who served as bushes correspondence director for two years. she says those with clearance to use the autopen would head over to the executive clerks office in the eisenhower executive office building, next to the white house, where the autopen wielded bushes pen of choice    a charpie.autopens have been used by presidents since wight eisenhower, says koschal, and president john f. penned put them to heavy use. many presidents have had secretaries sign their names to correspondence and documents, he says.more than 200 years ago, thomas jefferson acquired a mechanical copying device called a polygraph that attached to his pen and made a second copy of what he was writing. jefferson liked it so much he wrote that i could not, now therefore, live without the polygraph.its not just busy presidents who rely on autopens. there used by thousands of organizations, companies and government officials.donald h. rumsfeld got in hot water for using one as defense secretary to sign letters of condolence to the families of u.s. troops killed in action. when word leaned out in 2004, rumsfeld said head done it to ensure expeditions contact with grieving family members.i have directed that in the future i sign each letter, he said.other officials and candidates have fingered the autopen as an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for documents that appeared to bear their names. one was union executive kenneth lay, who was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and lying to banks despite his lawyers arguments that he shouldn be held accountable for documents signed by autopen. his conviction was later vacated on other grounds.so how to tell the difference between a real signature and an autopen version?koschal says the best way to detect a face is to lay the signature in question over a known autopen version and hold the two documents up to a light. if there exactly the same, chances are that the top one was created with an autopen. but presidents often create multiple autopen signatures to make it less obvious when there letting a machine do the work.as for obama's autopen signature on the extension of patriot act powers, it may pass the constitutional test, but not koschal's.ind pay peanuts for it, the autograph authenticator said. its not a real signature.
776,my 5 year old son just couple of days ago started showing signs of old ' (touching something too many times with hands or feet, pulling his t-shirt down because its bothering him around the neck, tapping with his foot on the ground while walking, etc).    one of the stressors may be his extreme jealousy of his younger sitting, or my constant reminders to play nicely, both with his brother and other kiss.    he has a tendency not to keep hands to himself...otherwise, he is out of kindergarten for the summer (where academically he does fairly well), so he tends to have pretty relaxed days (apart from swimming lessons on most afternoon).    both me and my husband are prone to anxiety but have never been diagnosed or on beds.

784,my soon to be five year old is still behaving like a toller in school.    he will often go down on his hands and knees and crawl into class, he has poor fine motor skill and is very tactile, he refuses to go willingly to activities and he sometimes has huge antrum.    he is a very bright boy, the youngest of three and i thought that school would be a breeze for him.    the school head teacher called him a troubled child and has expressed concerns about him.    he was possessed by a special needs teacher and she said that he is emotional very young but cognitive very bright.does anyone know why it is taking him so long to mature and is it normal for a five year to be so emotional young?
785,i had sex on with of this month and i lobulated on the with. every since that day my breast has become really sore and why is this ?
786,where to begin?    well, my husband and i have been separated since april, and we have yet to get back together..the separation was his idea.    we have 2 children ages 7 and 2 and since our separation the kiss have been judged from one house to another..he lives with his parents and i live with my dad.    we separated for many reasons, but the main 2 reasons we separated was finances and the way that he treated me compared to his family.    my husband is 2 years younger than i am, ism 27 and hers 25.    he has always been a very family tormented person, and i dont mean with me and my kiss, but ism talking about with his mon, dad and sisters.    he constantly would put them before me and never really considered how i felt about it.    a few months after we separated, we started trying to work things out and things seemed to have been going a lot better for us, he was working on his issues and i was working on mine.    over the past few months i have been really pushing for us to get a house together and become a family again so that our kiss can have stability, and he agrees with me, tells me that he loves me and that he wants our marriage to work, but then once the conversation takes place that specific day, nothing ever gets mentioned about it again.    about a month ago, my mother passed away at the age of 46 unexpectedly, very tragic on me and my family.    my husband was semi-suppurative for a few days after it happened, but once the funeral was over with he went back to his normal life and never really seemed to care about what i was and still am going through.    my husband is 25, lives with his parents, doesn have to pay any bills and just works odd jobs here and there to have money.    i keep pushing him to get a job so that we can potential buy a house in the near future, but its like i am talking to a brick wall.    i have been so sad and depressed about what has happened with my mother, and the fact that my husband is not being very suppurative makes me feel very lonely.    he goes days at a time without even speaking to me, and then calls me or let me phrase that, he texts me and acts like everything is great.    i have recently started counselling to help me deal with not only my mothers death but with my marriage issues.    i am at a point to where i canst take much more, and i really dont know what to do anymore.    my husband tells me that he loves me, but he really hasn shown me over the past few months that he gives a rats a** about me.    i dont want my kiss to continue in the chaos of our separation, but i really dont know what to do anymore.    i truly do love him, but i feel like i am the only one who really cares. please any advice would help.

793,what do you think of this article?_________________i live in los angeles, which may well be ground zero for spiritual movements in the united states. many such groups got their start here, and the diversity of faith and movements is impressive - from old to new, from sincere to shady, from truly elevating to downright toxic.people engage in all manner of practice here -- singing, chanting, doing you, donning exotic clothes, and sometimes even going so far as changing their names or, even more drastic, getting tattoo. for the new seeker, the variety can be bewildering; to the septic, proof of frivolity. they canst all possibly matter, and they canst all be right at the same time now, can they?faced with all these choice, spirituality can be a dancing concept. what does it really mean to be spiritual? a hundred people will respond a hundred different ways, so i wont pretend to have the universal answer. what i can tell you is what spirituality means to me. it comes down to five simple principles:1) be the best possible version of you.from the day your born, your days on this planet are numbered. at this rate, ism guessing have got 22,000 more to go. the good news is that during this time, there nothing holding you back from striving for excellence in every endeavor you undertake. so give your best in your work and your friendships and diffuse it all with love.so you have this extraordinary opportunity to develop your talents in all kinds of spheres. got a knack for cooking? pick up a cookbook and start experimenting on your friends at dinner parties. have an ear for music? noble on a guitar and learn some chords. good at languages? listen to some audit courses and say get me a beer in 24 tongues.some of these skill will be more fun and others will be more useful. arguably, the most rewarding skill will be those that end up enriching the lives of those around you as well as your own. which brings us to the second point.2) treat others exceptionally well.the essence of spirituality is realizing that at the very bottom, all humans are much more similar than different. therefore spirituality is not about trappings, conventions, rituals or adherence to doctrine. its simply about how well you treat others.so if you think that those with a different creed or costume are not deserving of your compassion, then your not really spiritual, regardless of how much prayer or meditation you put in. but if your an atheist who a source of elevation and enrichment to all those around you - hate to break it to you, but your spiritual.spirituality manifests in action, so let go of dogma and ritual. instead, resolve to treat people exceptionally well. that is the essence of compassion.3) practice enlightened self-interest.have observed that when you act at all times with your long-term self-interest in mind, you usually ends up taking the most compassionate course of action. i call this the long-now midst; in fact, there a whole group of forward thinkers in san francisco dedicated to this way of thinking, the long now foundation.let me illustrate with an example. lets say you want to buy a car. you may think, well, i like big cars, so ism donna get me one of these bass sums. that super short-term thinking. then you think, him, gas prices are only going to rise, so maybe i should get a smaller car. that longer term. then: know, if ism going to have kiss some day and dont want their school to be under water, maybe i should do my part to reduce greenhouse gas missions. ill get a horrid. by thinking about your self-interest a generation or two down the road, you end up doing the compassionate thing.moist thought is suspicious about taking actions because there good or noble - its all about practically. that what i like about long-now thinking: its less about being nice than it is about being smart.4) think independently of circumstancenewsflash: today, you are not just home happens, or thinking man. you are home happens happens, thinking thinking man (and woman).what the anthropologists who named the human race had in mind originally i canst speculator. but to me, it means that you, the crown jewel of all creation, able to peer into the depths of the universe that birth you and fathom its origins, are capable of thought. and not just thought, but thought about thought.you can be thinking one moment, a man, that ******* just cut me off - i hate him! and the next second you can think, well, that silly - hers probably just late for work, and proceed to chuckle about the incident and continue along your merry way.what you did there was a skill unique to humans called metacognition, or thinking about thinking. in addition to your ability to have thoughts about thoughts, its also your general ability to direct thought independently of circumstance.if in delicate moments you've ever chosen to focus on baseball scores or george colonel instead of the task at hand, congratulations - you have performed metacognition.ladies and gentlemen - this is kind of a big deal.one could say that strengthening your metacognition muscle is the essence of all eastern spiritual practice. to be the calm in the storm, to transmuted hate into love, to choose the best action instead of reacting to circumstance unconsciously - these are all metacognitive skill and the goal of meditative practice.as an added bonus, metacognitive skill may also be the foundation of sidelong success, as elaborated in this brilliant article by john letter in this weeks new worker. young children who are able to suppress their urges for immediate gratification by directing their attention end up being much more successful as adults.5) practice gratitude.if your reading this now, chances are you have a roof over your head, clean clothes on your body, and a decent internet connection - i.e., a lot to be grateful for.so appreciate everything that you may have taken for granted - friends, family, food, shelter, health, fully slippers. gratitude is its own reward - the more you practice it, the better you'll feel. make it a practice every morning to set aside a few minutes to jot down five things your grateful for. after just a week, you'll be surprised by the list and learn a lot about what really matters to you.so if your running around developing yourself while doing things you enjoy, making people feel great around you while keeping yourself in good stead over the long term, and controlling your thoughts so they create your happiness and success while being grateful about it all, your not just being spiritual - your winning at life. and you dont need any trappings for that - just you will do.......dr. flex benzerauthor, to of dating for women, to of dating for menposted: may 28, 2009 05:12 pm
794,so, i am currently over 37 weeks pregnant.    do and i had talked and decided months ago that a vasectomy was probably our best option since we are not planning to have any more children.    the problem is, that is as far as it went so far, talk ll.    we have discussed it several times since then and i even suggested he do it soon b/c i know it isn an immediate solution.     i read on one of the forms here that it can take up to a year for vasectomy to take full effect (and dont even make me think about the lady that told me her neighbors do had one, and she got pg, then she had a tubal and got pg again!!    i now that is very rare but org, the thought terrified me! ll)    from what i understand is you have to keep going back to the urologist with a    sample so they can check if there are any speak left and it is not considered safe until the sample is cleared.    i told do that and he didn seem to have any problem with it and was still on board.    even agreed it should be done soon (this was months ago) since i obviously canst get pg while pg and for the weeks after the birth when we have to abstain.    well...??    the baby is due any day now and still no appointment, and he has not brought up the subject again.    i dont want to push him to do something he really doesn want to do, so i am not going to badge him on the issue, he obviously has some hesitation or it would be done.    but i need some form of birth control soon.    i had to get off the pill b/c i was getting migraines all the time and was lethargy, moody, and hated the fact that weight would not come off no matter what i did.    i am thinking of getting an mud.    the copper one though b/c as i stated i do not do well with mormons.    anyone have experiences, good or bad, to share about this form of bc?just wanted to ask anyone experiences with any of these methods: vasectomy, copper mud or tubal.    i am scared of the tubal b/c of pain, scarring, other possible complications, mormons going out-of-hack, and have read that it can also cause weight gain.    any help, advice, or personal experiences would help, thanks!
795,hi everyone. i am new to this forum and i was wondering if anyone can help me with a problem i have been having for the past two and a half years. i am 22 yes old and i have persistent bacterial vaginitis, with other things such as least infections and urinary tract infections from time to time. lately, new symptoms are emerging that causes pain around the anus. i wonder if the infection has spread.doctors treated me with antibiotics, metrodidazole, diflucan, and hemroidal cream during the past. my ti and least infection symptoms went away but the bacterial vaginitis persisted. i experience pain around the vulva every time i take a stride and sex can be painful.this all started when i was treated for my asthma with steroids such as prednisone, and lots of antibiotics.    i am also on a daily osteoid-based inhaled.    i wonder if the meditations had missed up my body somehow, and if i had lost the good bacteria to fight off the antigens in my vagina. and if it is, is it reversible?i see the doctor at least once every two months because the symptoms always come back. i am clean, and have tried everything i can think of from wearing cotton underwear and loose clothing everyday to eating your daily. if anyone has any other suggestions, can you please let me know or refer me to someone who can help? i would really appreciate it. thank you =)this discussion is related persistent bacterial vaginitis.

797,is will be 2 in november and do and i are kind of worried. i read a few different things on the web that say 18-20 months he should have around 20-30 words in his vocabulary and should be putting two words together (daddy big, baby crying..etc). he doesn have nearly that many words. he says data, mamma, hi, more, that...and pretty much that it. he usually points to what he wants or will pull our hands to show us what he wants instead of trying to say it.i was wondering if anyone else has had an experience with their child like this and do you guns think we should go get his hearing and everything tested? it worries us especially since a little over a month of when he turns two, we will have the new baby and it will be much harder to take as much time to get him to communicate to me what he wants rather then just saying it.any and all advice would be greatly appreciated thanks!! =]

815,i have posted here before but i am still dealing with this issue:i moved down to florida from no for glad school to get my masters in occupational therapy, 6 months later i met my current boyfriend who i have been with 1 year and a half. when i first started dating him i knew he went to college but did not finish, which i was resistant to at first but he had a good job as a general manager at a store making decent money. 4 months later the store closed and he was out of a job for 5 months which i understood because of the economy. he held that job for 5 months then they let him go the end of march because they could not afford to pay him anymore. since then he has not had a job, he says he looking but he pick because he wants a job that is in his preferred salary range. i think he is currently collecting unemployment, i say i think because when i ask him he does not like to talk about it because he embarrassed.    he does side work once in a while for a friend for his company and said they are looking to hire so he sent them his resume but he keeps saying that since april.i just graduated this weekend and have 3 months of fieldwork left. i go to fieldwork everyday and he at home watching to or on some days he will drill and drink with the guns. we dont go on many dates because i can afford to pay for him. even though i dont have clot of money i will get him little surprise here and there. he will cook dinner for and do sundry but i do that too. for my birthday he got me very nice gifts and put clot of thought but didn get me anything for my granulation (in not sure if i should of expected anything?).    i love him and his family but he is not financially responsible. at the end of november i have to decide to stay in this relationship or not. i want to move closer to no where my family is also.i just dont know if i am over thinking this situation? what do you think?
816,i had unfrocked sex on feb 26/27, we used a london but half the time we also didn use one. i no pre-*** can make a pregnancy occur but i think the chances are slim. i was supposed to get my period on march with, but i still didn get it up to day. its 9 days late and counting. i am experiencing terrible back pain, my breasts are so sore they hurt every time i roll over in bed. i didn gain weight, a ll bit of nausea but no vomiting. no weird food craving, and now ism getting a white creamy discharge, just a very little. my period never been this late before, ism planning on taking a pregnancy test by next week tuesday and a blood test later that week. may my body just be footing me that in pregnant? it sometimes feels like its all in my head yet these symptoms r really happening.
817,it seems that my last in 1999 resulted in binocular diploma. i started fairly nearsighted both eyes    (-7) with strabismus of the left eye (outward).    (eye muscle surgery at 9 only for cosmetic purposes; never wore press).    initially went farsighted after last to approve. +2 and started to see 2 after 6 weeks.    after about 2 years and working with my new eye surgeon we finally realized that the position of my eyes changed and my strabismus eye was now going cross-eyed, thus the seeing 2.    a total of 7 forgeries later between the 2 eyes with the most recent 6 weeks ago, my problem has significantly improved.    again, the better my good eye sees, the less i see 2.    my strabismus eye had been corrected back to -1 a few years ago and this off balance with my good eye seemed to be the final step in fixing my problem.    (to add to the problem, i was now at reading glasses stage and i essentially ended up with monovision.    and monovision does not work when you have strabismus so that caused yet another problem)    that is, my surgeon performed last on the eye to correct the -1 and my off balance feeling is gone and my eyes seem to be back to their old (albeit 8 years ago) position.    so essentially, my initial last resulted in a change in eye position and the battle of the eye muscles.is this something that has become an issue with last (apparently at that time no dr. had heard of this and i saw many days!).

841,my son and i recently took an afternoon to spend together alone.    after weeks of wanting to go bowing i took him last saturday.    he is very competitive and started getting frustrated when i had more points than him.    when his turn was over he started getting very angry.    i sat down next to him to explain that he gets to bowl twice, and then i get to bowl twice.    while trying to explain this to him, he slapped me across the face!    i was devastated and shocked.    i said get your shoes on, we are leaving.    i paid for the unfinished game and turned in our shoes.    we went to the car and i started crying.    this only seemed to make him more upset.    i told him we do not hit.    this is something he knows.    he has been told this repeatedly, as he occasionally will hit his younger brother (months).when he was two he had a really hard time with hitting.    we worked on this behavior and i thought we had gotten over the worst of it.    he no longer and hasn for a long time, hits other kiss for toys, etc....    he is very competitive and particular about the way things are done.    but clearly, hitting mon is way out of line.    what do i do?    i dont think this is normal behavior for a four year old.....

846,ok so here is the problems 22yrs old i have never had any problems with periods till i was 19, no cramps, no floating, no nothing. the first symptom was constipation. i was given finer, laxitives, pills, i was told i ate too much spice foods, i was told it was irritable bowl syndrome, i went to the doctor several times only to come out with different answers, different medicine and no cure. secondly, i started to feel some discomfort in my periods. one period i thought i was dying and almost went to the hospital. my aunt came over and told me it was probably just a bad cramp and so i waited it out and sure enough my period came shortly after and the mysterious pain stopped. so i was good for a few more months no pain or anything. then my side started hurting. i shrugged it off at first but after a couple of days it got worse and night i just couldn sleep. i went to the hospital and they said i had an ovarian cyst, that lucky exploded when i got there so no surgery was needed. they gave no explanation as to why i had one and sent me on my way.third, a couple months later i started getting insane pain during my periods and was still constipated with mucus. the pain got so bad i started throwing up and idol nor pamprin would work only ibuprofen. meanwhile i got a colonospy done and found nothing. i got an edocospy done and they said i had acid reflux which is obvious bus if the food can go down it will come back up. i also got a ultrasound and they said things were ok. fourthly, at first i thought it was just my imagination but then i realised it was real, the blood during my period was coming out my rectal area. so now during my periods, they were heavy, they hurt so bad i threw up, and they gave me diahrea with bloody stool. i went to the doctor saying i was throwing up, my stomach hurt, i had diahrea and i was on my period. he gave me a shot in the but and said i had food poisoning. eventually i got prescribed ibuprofen 400mg then 600mg for the pain. later i went back to the doctor had another ultrasound, they said i had fluid in my varies which they thought mine be period blood and so i was referred to a no. the no said i had endometriosis. she gave me birth control for it and moved up my ibuprofen prescription to 800mg. a year later still having the same horrible periods, birth control is doing anything. the pain tillers help but when i dont take them i still have harmful periods. in tired of going back and forth to the doctor and nothing is working.

872,dont touch my june,' is taking on new meaning.truck nuts, face bull testicle made of plastic or metal that drivers hang on the back of their pickets to make a truck look more manly, have been around for years. some find them funny, while others find them offensive, prompting at least three states to try to ban them -- successfully.but a recent case in south carolina is feeling debate over whether these ornaments violate a states decency laws and if attempting to regulate them infringes on freedom of speech.on july 5, virginia time, 65, from bonnet, s.c. pulled her picked truck into a local gas station with red, face testicle dangling from the trailer pitch. the towns police chief, franco full, pulled up and asked her to remove the plastic testicle.when she refused, he wrote her a $445 ticket saying that she violated south carolina  s scene jumper stick law.the south carolina code of laws reads,   a stick, deal, emblem, or device is indecent    in a patiently offensive way, as determined by contemporary community standards, sexual acts, excretory functions, or parts of the human body.  time lowered up and said that she was preparing to challenge full in court. but before she could ask for a jury trial, full, in a rare move, beat her to it.full says he is pushing for a jury trial and hopes the outcome will clarify the state  s obscurity laws, leaving no room for misinterpretation.  the law is very clear, and i am prepared to take it all the way,   full told foxes.com.scott bischoff, time  s lawyer, says his client is not bowing down because   this whole thing was caused by the arresting officer, who is arbitrarily interpreting a statute incorrectly.  bischoff will argue whether these large, red, plastic testicle are   really an accurate deduction of a human body part.    he is nuts,   says jay tender, a lawyer and professor at the university of south carolina, referring to full and his interpretation of the law. tender says although tactless and stupid, they are not illegal, and adds,   chief full is abusing his arrest powers.   he says the statute is very clear about what material is scene and   it doesn  t have anything to do with artificial bull testicle.  david hudson, a first amendment attorney and scholar, says laws banking these types of deals, emblem or jumper sticks are problematical, but often someone just hasn  t challenged them.hudson believes time and her lawyer can make a good case the south carolina law is   unconstitutional vague and unconstitutional board, and it violates the first amendment.  in the past, lawmakers in tennessee, virginia, maryland and florida have proposed legislation to ban these types of deals and other explicit jumper sticks.hudson detailed many cases where law enforcement officials cited individuals for the content of their jumper sticks, and in the majority of those cases, a judge tossed them out because   the first amendment protects a great deal of offensive expression.  hudson also cities the supreme court  s opinion that   the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.  even though the attempts to ban truck nuts have been unsuccessful, customers are still very about their reality.trick trunks, a truck accessory chain, has been selling them for years and has had customers question whether they are illegal. keith millard says sales at his langham, md., store are hit and miss, but   when people talk about outlying or banking them, they come in to buy them up.    i can  t see a piece of plastic being offensive, it  s not like you can  t see that along the road, there are farms all over,   says on pelletier, assistant manager of the trick trunks in waldo, md. both say most people buy them as gag gifts.neither side in bonnet, s.c., is laughing over this legal mess, but they do agree the public interest in the case is shocking. full said that he  s been getting a lot of feedback from people, including one florida woman who stopped by the police station to say she was glad he wrote the ticket, while another man called to ask,   if we didn  t have anything better to do?    we concur with the sentiments of people in our community and across the nation that this whole thing is a big waste of time, but it was all started by chief full,   says bischoff.the case goes to trial next month.read more: http://www.foxes.com/us/2011/08/02/hanging-truck-nuts-grows-into-free-speech-debate/#ixzz1tt7nudnu

888,hi ism concerned about my left eye i been noticed for several months now on a black spot in my vision i read the other posts to see if anything was mentioned about it but i mean its like u said flowers but here is the trick it doesn float around its in one spot all the time unless i move my eye ball to the side but it moves with the eye if i look left its not that noticeable but i look right its noticeable and same when i look straight. i also at times get these ash looking (is the best way to describe it) spots but it also flicked and seems like ash is really falling in front of me, what i mean by flicked not like a light switch but like a light bulb electric wire that makes light bright then fades on occasions and that only my left eye my right i have a twitch that i canst say how often or if there is a pattern because it occurs off and on. for example it will twitch one day out of the blue the twitching lasts for about a minute then stops and it happens again and lasts a ll over a minute then stops i tried to just rub it away maybe its my nerves lightning up but when an episode happens it tends to drag out for an hour off and on like i said. but that not my main concern, ism more worried about my left eye. but would like some advise on what going on with both of them. i been to eye doctors as a child nothing was detected but i was told to wear glasses when i didn even need them. i have twenty/ twenty vision so i know what ever is wrong has not affected my vision but i was at age 19 told to were glasses again due to my studies that required being in front of a computer screen for 8 hours a day if not more. and ism talking without no breaks. my vision ended up in both eyes becoming flurry like water in my eyes but i had no tears nor water in my eyes they were normal. i also have these bad headache that are i would have to say by my eyes. i described the feeling and where it was coming from to family and a family doctor they said its a migrate. yet i didn have sensitivity to light nor noise. just the pain that was coming from the back of my eyes to the front and even the sides like if it could just be a tension headache. i tried over the counter grain medicine, civil, ibrophin, trional, aspirin, alive, a frozen eye mask even nothing seems to work for the pain so i just deal with it. i have never been given an mr on my brain but been told to get one done but i dont know if that would even help either or am i wrong. i have had my head banged up on payment, concrete, large objects, such as hard cover thick thick books, bath, basically hard objects to the head as i was young and sometimes i get pushed hard where i hit my head on a cabinet door and i have blocked out a couple of times when hit or hit my head i have never been taken to the hospital though to get checked due to me being afraid of doctors and also that trust that i dont have with them. i honestly dont see a doctor unless i have to for a female the yearly check up and to get antibiotics if i have an infection but so you are aware my last visit everything is normal blood and urine came out fine no diabetes, no high cholestrol, nothing not even high blood pressure. the only thing wrong with me is my weight but my health is as if an active healthy weight person if not better just a weight issue. so i am confused i mean in my family eye problems are a thing but like i said all the eye doctors i have seen said i have perfect vision and there is no need for glasses nor do i have anything wrong with my eyes. i have had a wire danger jammed into my right eye and that when i started the twitching in that eye so i can see that as a reason why my eye twitches. and no i didn seek medical attention when i got help to remove the danger and that happened oh i would have to say when i was about 10 1/2 11 years old i am currently 23 years old by the way. back to the headache i know it has to deal with my eyes since the pain is only coming from my eyes and no where else at times my eye sockets hurt so much that it even hurts to blink my eyes get blood shocked and when they are really bad i end up with nose bleeds. or even wake up with my pillow covered in blood ism totally concerned and i dont know what to do first when i mention my headache to my primary physician i get a feeling as if hers not listening so i just gave up and like i said i been dealing with the pain. also the agitation of the black spot and ash at times in the left eye and twitching in the right. but like the twitching has been like that for or 18 1/2 years so ism kind of used to it by now. its just the ash thing and black spot but i would like to get you opinion and maybe some advise on what i should do first. headache are an everyday thing just other days are worse then others i canst tolerate it any more i dont want to have to go my whole life with headache and wired eye things going on. so i come to you for your professional opinion and well some guidance on what i need to do and if its something major or just something mild and can be taken cared of. please help!!!!! i dont know what else to do. and i feel as if ism not taking the right way about all of this so i would like your help if you can please even if you have no clue on what wrong at least point me in the right direction as of what i need to do and get done first. thank you for your time. a concerned individual
889,i have been running for about 6 months now, i started off slow and only covered about km or so and now ism doing up to km. i am tall so a faster pace is always easier for me and i sometimes throw one or two splints in the distance.what i have noticed recently though is that my calves are looking pretty bulky!! it is annoying me because i am a teenage girl and bulky limbs dont look too good.i have been running quite regularly recently since getting an exercise muddy and i usually cover 3-km run with two splints in it and a 5-minute brisk hill walk and then a ten minute slow walk to cool down.if this is how i exercise 3-times a week, what can i do to avoid getting very bulky calves and adding to my built look and also any tips for quickly cutting down inner thigh fat?thanks so, so much! xx

892,a cavity was discovered under the supporting crown for my bridge.    the bridge was removed and the dentist stated in order to save this tooth, which already had a root canal, it would be necessary for the dental surgeon to build this tooth up, since the decay is at or below the gum line, before putting on a new crown.    how is the tooth built up?    my other option is dental plants.

894,hi,me and my partner had protected sex 16 days ago (sept 14), but he pulled out before organs and we didn think much of it. 12 days ago the london broke so we got the morning after pill. i was originally planning on starting birth control on my next period, and the pharmacist said that i could start and the morning after pill wouldn make a difference. so when my next period started (or what i thought was my period), 7 days ago, i took the first dose of birth control pills. and the instructions say that if you take it on the first day of your period then your apparently protected from there on. so we had protected sex again, but then there was no bleeding the next day. so i got worried that it was just discharge (my last period was on september st, so the dates seem to be fine, but ism not sure now since there was no bleeding afterwards) i took a home pregnancy test today and it came out negative, but ism still worried. is there still a chance i could be pregnant?thanks

898,hi bullet me give you a brief background. my baby would not sleep the first 3 weeks of her life. thankful my mother figured out that she had gas. so we fixed that problem by me not drinking any milk and receiving the gas. ok at the same time my mon took nighttime duty for 3 nights to give me a break (aaaahhh) well mon had the baby sleep in her carpet. the baby slept for 6-8 hours and has ever since then.    since then my baby will not sleep in her crib....and honestly i voted for more sleep than to fight with my baby whom i fought with for the first 3 glassy weeks of her life.    i have transition her to nap in her crib during the day but her caps (honestly) stink. she is up an hour, down an hour up and hour down an hour. she has always been a bad sleeper.    then at night we do her routine that we have been doing since week 4 (baby is now 11 weeks old). its bath, d and play, feeding, put her to sleep in the car seat awake and give her the pacifier. she goes to sleep and will wake up 40 mind later crying. we go in after 5 mind to south her, then if she cry again we give her 6 mind    then 7 etc. it usually take us about 2 hours to get her down. ok so i was thinking that she is getting big enough to sleep in her crib since she caps in the crib. so tonight we did the routine (bed, d and play, feeding) and i put her in the crib awake and turned on the week a too aquarium thing i got from target. my baby loves this thing. she watch it and drifted off to sleep with no issues. well she woke up 40 mind later (just like she does in the carpet) and so i did the same routine of waiting 5 mind, 6, 7 etc before going in to south her. well i got up to waiting 15 mind and the baby is crying nonstop. the only thing that soothe her is if i turn on the aquarium thing but she cry when that is done ( about 12 mind later).    needless to say i asked the hobby to get the carpet out of my car. baby is in the car seat right now sleeping like an angel.    i want to transition her now before i go back to work (on 03/16)ok so here is my questionwhat did other moss do to transition their baby from the carpet to the crib? please dont tell me to elevate the mattress unless that worked for you. my baby caps in her crib with no problem (even if its only an hour nap..she has always been a bad nipper) is this just a phase my baby will grow out of and she will let me know when she is ready for her crib? is there a specific technique any of you other moss have done to get her used to her crib? someone said to buy another changing table and put the baby in that since it kind of cradle them. please give me details too.    when did your baby get out of the carpet? how long did it take (1 week, 1 month, 1 day etc) and most importantly    what did your baby do during this transition (cranks, cried for 15 mind, or just fine and slept better)i feel like such a happy mon because i feel like i can understand my baby. i feel like she rates me because she cry at everything when i try to change her routine up.(stubborn just like daddy :)sorry for the long post. i really want my baby to    sleep well. her crib looks so much more comfortable than the carpet...plus i am worried about a flat head.
899,i always have normal periods. i am so used to my birth control that i always start on or around the time of my space pills. this month i started my period at the time of my space pills on dec. th. it was a normal 6 day/regular flow period for me ending on the with. to my surprise i started again on christmas eve... dec. with. so from the end of one period, to the beginning of another was only 9 days apart. it is currently day 10 of this second period. the first 7 days were just as a normal period... maybe a bit heavier than usual... and these past 3 days have been pure brown discharge only. no blood.what could be causing this? 2 periods in 1 month and plus the brown discharge following?

902,to anyone who might have insight,i entered the military a 19, and have served six years in the air national guard, and the past two in the army national guard until present. i will be hitting my 8 years of service this december 2010. i have about accumulated about 3 years of active service for training and various active duty hours. no overseas hours, i volunteered, but never deployed to combat, though i did spent a year in wait as an army civilian. i am 26 now, and a e-5/sat. in the army national guard. full-time, i am civilian service in the army community. my most is public affairs, and i am attached to an mad (mobile public affairs detachment) national guard unit. in one capacity or another, in uniform or out, i have served this country since 2003.i remember having pain throughout most of my adult life, and thinking it was normal. i went through bootcamp and it with it. after the pain escaped during my time in wait, i began seeking professional care through my civilian healthcare, and returned to the states after my commitment at the end of the year. i went through about two years of testing and working symptoms to include pain and insomnia. it got so bad to the point of depression, problems with work and family, and just be able to fully function. i was finally diagnosed this past september with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. after finding a great dr. and working on a multi-vacated treatment plan, i am not cured but sanctioning better than i have in two years.because my diagnosis is recent, my name has not come up for employment, and i have been able to muster through drill periods for the last two years, i have not yet disclosed this information to the army national guard. i am concerned that if i do, i will be    discharged and lose my current education benefits. i am also concerned because i have served 8 years of service, and am i not finished. i have a spotless service record, and only one line-of-duty injury that i have been able to recover from for the most part. i want to deploy still, and finish serving my time. i do not know how the army or veterans affairs will treat me because of the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue and serving mostly as a national guard member or army civilian, and not on regular active duty. at this point, i am taking regular meditations and being treated for pain management weekly, still passing it diagnostic unless ism am in the middle of a flair-up, and continuing to perform to the best of my abilities. there is no known cause, or cure for this, and only my former it, who is no longer a guard member, is aware of the condition. i am being treated with several meditations that help with pain and insomnia, physical and massage therapy, and doing regular you and exercise.though i am doing well now, i do not know how my condition would react should i have to deploy or attend training courses i will coming up for, such as was, act. i had also hoped to apply to a combat camera unit (airborne) with a high employment temps, a goal i have now put on hold until i can figure out a game plan.    though i want to deploy, i understand the risk i could put others in if i am not healthy in combat zone.i am not looking for an out from the military, nor am i looking for guidance on how to get the military to give me a disability rating. ism looking for guidance on how i might be treated when, or if i even should, disclose this information to the military, and hoping to find anyone with experience with this, or a doctor in the military community that might now what would come next. thank you.
903,i saw this on can last night and was glad i could find it to post.    its interesting and makes me really wonder what will happen come nov.    it seems that the majority of americans still hold the republicans and george bush responsible for the current economic situation.    yet at the same time the majority do not approve of the job drama is doing with it.    in my mind this makes the nov. elections interesting...it sure doesn sound like its cut and dry to me.    i wonder what will happen.    anyway, here is the article.....81% rate u.s. economy as poor - can pollfaith kari, can newsdesk editorseptember 5, 2010: 9:42 am washington (can) -- a new national poll released sunday indicates that eight in 10 americans say that the economy is in poor shape, and the number that say conditions are very poor is on the upswing after steady decline through the spring.and according to a can/opinion research corporation survey, more people blame the republicans over the democrats for the country economic problems.* 24** 0diggsdigg* email* print* commenteighty-one percent of the public rates the countess economic conditions as poor, with 18% describing the economy as good. forty-four percent of people questioned describe economic conditions as very poor, up seven points from july.the poll indicates that roughly half the country says that conditions have not improved in the past two years. the other half says that the economy has gotten better, but many of them expect things will get worse in the near future.0:00 /37:05'uncertainty' threatens u.s. economyroughly a third of all americans say that the economy has gotten better and will continue to do so, says can polling director eating holland. but one in five say that things have gotten better but will take a turn for the worse in the months ahead -- essentially predictions the double-dip that many economists are worried about.so which party gets the blame for the country current economic problems?according to the survey, more americans hold the republicans responsible than the democrats, with 44% blaming the go and 35% picking the democrats.and when george w. bushes name is added to the mix, the number who blame the republicans rises to 53%, with just a third saying that back drama and his party are at fault. that indicates why the democrats are likely to mention bushes name every chance they get between now and election day, holland said.happy labor day, workers!but according to numbers released friday, just four in 10 americans say they approve of the job president back drama is doing on the economy.the 40% who give drama a thumbs up is a new low for the president on the economy in can polling.the can/opinion research corps. poll was conducted wednesday and thursday, with 1,024 adult americans questioned by telephone. the surveys overall smiling error is plus or minus three percentage points.-- can deputy political director paul steinhauser contributed to this report.    to top of page

922,my daughter    is increasingly acting out in violent ways towards me (i am a single parent) and nothing seems to help.    i have tried every kind of time out imaginable, restraining her, and even just ignoring her.she will jump on me, grafting my throat, scratching, kicking, hitting, slapping, and biting.    she will throw chairs, ice packs, my purse, or just about anything in reach.    she will slam doors and scream.other behavior/attitude concerns are: she doesn want to leave the house, either for school or grocer shopping, or simply to make friends in our neighborhood - she has asked me to not pressure her that she will make friends when she is ready to.she has locked herself in her room before to avoid going to school.she can go on for hours about how hard her life is...listing extremely trivial things...she got ragged it at school with her friends, she stabbed her toe the other day...things like that.i have tried listening sympathetically, as well as telling her to stop the nativity and talk about something positive.she says that she is not sleeping well, that her thoughts wont stop thinking so she can fall asleep easier.she has been in therapy for years already, i called the police this morning, what could be the cause/solution to this kind of behavior?please understand, my daughter is bright, verbally precious, and capable of holding it together at school etc.she doesn seem able to know what makes her so angry, or able to take any responsibility for her actions.    she says that i make her throw things, hit, scream, etc. she will completely turn around when others are around, acting as if everything is fine/normal etc.    when i say no its not, she flies off the handle again as soon as we are alone.she has seen me abused by her paternal grandmother - i left her, got my daughter in therapy, etc.    i know that some anger is normal - but this is not.there is history of mental illness in her family, father was i-polar, his sister has never emotional problems, their mother is extremely violent, but again, a charmer when she wants to be, possibly sociopathic?    but i know for certain that her father was schizophrenic.i dont know what to do, at this point her therapist is even out of suggestions.    i plan to take her in to the county hospital today for an evaluation - i just canst think of anything else to do.what could be causing this?

925,my daughter who just turned 5 in april started kindergarten. she has never been to preschool or daycare as i am a stay at home mon. on her assessment test she scored a little low and the teacher acted like maybe i should hold her until she was 6 but then i talked to the counselor who assured me my did would get intervention and be caught up.her teacher called me at home from her home after only the fifth full day of school and wanted to discuss some things with me. the first thing is that my daughter had her shoe off for whatever reason and took her shoe to the teacher and just held it to her b/c she needed help putting it back on but she wouldn ask,i should add my child is very shy and reserved especially in a public setting, the teacher told me she asked my child what she needed a few times and she wouldn answer so she took her out in the hall and sat her down and and told her if she wanted her shoe back on she would have to ask so my child screamed put my shoe on and was upset. the next thing is that she asked them all (there are 26 kiss in this class) to take out the blue carbon and my daughter took out pink (she knows her colors) and refused to get blue out so the teacher took the pink carbon away from her and this upset my daughter. she also told me my child has a hard time following 3 and 4 part directions and that that concerns her. she told me it may be a good idea to talk to my child dr. about this. she made me cry because she is acting like there is something wrong with my child! i had a talk with my daughter and she has been doing better on her behavior and at listening to her teacher but the teacher says she is still not catching on like the other children and to talk to her dr. this concerns me. is there something wrong with my child? the teacher says my daughter is the only one out of 26 kiss to have these issues, is that believable? this is only her second week of any kind of choosing is this teacher jumping the gun? i feel like she has already single my child out. sorry this is so long but i am lost, this is the first child i have ever put in school. any advice will be great!thanks in advance,laurel

935,long story made short. my wife and i found ourselves only available to attend an easter vigil mass. we have a 2.5 year old and i felt that the expectation for him to endure a 3 hour mass was to great without behavior problems. my wife and her family believe that we should attend and when the behavior problems arouse, correct the problem and parent. i felt that we set this child up for failure. our 2.5 year old son had been removed from mass 4 times. my question then is this; what are reasonable expectations for a child of this age group?

945,newark, new jersey (can) -- stopped at a red light in a crime-cracked neighborhood of newark, new jersey, a 31-year-old woman watched as her friend plumped to the floor after a bullet smashed through the back window of the 31-year-old pontiac midian.i looked back and there was a german walking up on my car, said the driver, who declined to be named out of concerns for her safety.i turned away and he fired two more.as the shots rang out, she turned the wheel and hit the gas to escape what turned out to be the second fatal shooting that day in newark, where nearly a sixth of the city police force was laid off amid budget cuts about two years ago.and newark is by no means unique in implementing police cutbacks to save city money. meanwhile, violent crime soared 18% nationwide last year, marking the country first rise since 1993, while property crime also spike for the first time in a decade.hurry up, i canst breathe, mouthed wounded bronique mcleod, after the german unloaded three rounds at the midian where she was sitting with her friends just before midnight on october 1.the group then raced toward newark university hospital, but the 24-year-old mother of two began to lose consciousness.one of the bullets had punctured her lung, her family said later.when they got her on the turned she kept saying him dying, ism dying,' the driver recalled. please dont let me die. i have two kiss.'mcleod hung on until about 3 a.m. the next day, just hours after another victim died in a hail of bonfire in an unrelated incident about a mile away in the city south ward.her death is one of at least 71 homicidal so far this year in cash-strapped newark, where police say they have reorganized after more than 160 police officers were cut from the force in november 2010. last year the city tallied 74 murders through october, while violent crime soared despite earlier drops in the first years of mayor cry cookers administration.police expenditures in newark have since declined every year for the last three years, according to the city business administrator, julie x. heals, leaving corps to sustain public services with increasing resources.analysis say the trend isn unique.most cities have cut back since 2008 and the recession, though some more than others, said gregory minchak, a spokesman for the national league of cities.municipal administrators nationwide have since struggled to fill budget gaps amid decline in state aid, a stuttering economy, high employment and slowly rising costs in things like health care and public pensions.according to the washington-based cities organization, the effects of the financial crisis are also increasingly evident in city property tax revenues in 2012, after dropping 3.9% nationwide last year and thereby bringing in fewer dollars for municipal services.in short, the overall pie has gotten smaller, say city officials who point to the hundreds of public sector layoffs in newark in 2010.weave been in process of reducing our expenses pretty aggressive for the last three years, said heals, who routed improvements in the city tax collection efforts to help with the revenue side of the equation.naturally there a period where the rubber hits the road and there not that much left to cut.but last year newark ended up with an $18 million surplus in state aid, prompting republican go. chris christine to state that he want happy with the city 2012 requests for more assistance.i dont need new jersey largest city in any more financial trouble than its in already, the governor told reporter earlier this month, dispatching state officials to force budget cuts.still, in 2010, newark mayor said police layoffs were an unfortunate situation that was entirely available, and blamed the cuts on an unwillingness by police unions to negotiate needed reductions in the wake of the financial crisis. hooker said improvements in technologies and partnerships with federal agencies would help in the fight against crime, and pledged to sustain the number of officers patrolling the streets.but city police union vice president james stewart has argued that both patrols and detective squad have since been reduced, and that all the technology in the world wont replace the bodies you need to respond to crime and build practice policies.meanwhile, town and city halls in places including detroit, michigan; jacksonville, florida; kansas city, missouri; and stanton, pennsylvania, have tentatively put public sector jobs on the chopping block this year to help fill budget gaps.in january, the mayor of crime-ridden camden, new jersey, nearly halted its police force while cutting close to a third of its fire department in an effort to close a $26.5 million budget deficit.and as americans fiscal health continues to assume center stage on the campaign trail, how the nation will deal with its debts in the days after november is largely expected to play out in some way on the streets of cities like newark, detroit and camden.a silver lining may be that its finally forcing the discussion.were now having that frank public conversation about what do we want from government and how much do we want to pay for it, said brooding institution fellow trace gordon.law enforcement typically makes up large portions of most municipal budget and is often considered a prime target for cutbacks.every department is facing the same kind of issues of downsizing, said newark police director samuel demain.everybody has significantly less amount of police officers and you know there has to be a point where that comes to an end.newark residents such as natasha watson, who was a close friend of mcleod's, say they've become frustrated with the response from police, though they are equally disturbed by the so-called stitch code that keeps neighborhood witnesses quiet and away from authorities out of fear of retribution.newark is listed as one of only a handful of new jersey cities that maintain gangs with more than 200 members, according to a state survey. i know (police) are overwhelmed, watson said. people are dying but we want corps on the street doing something, she added.earlier this month, police arrested a 42-year-old city resident who is suspected in mcleod's murder.source: http://www.can.com/2012/10/28/us/new-jersey-newark-crime/index.html?hot=us_c2

947,what in the world should i do???my husband and i had a miscarriage over a year ago or so...and, right after i had my miscarriage was confirmed by a doctor through a blood test. when the nurse called me back to double confirm that i was indeed having a miscarriage, i asked her if i would have to go back in to get checked out, or have some follow up testing done or something....but she said i didn have to go back ever again if i didn want to...or something like that..you know, basically just to reassure me that i didn need to go back because i was supposedly fine. the only thing she did tell me to do was to hold off on trying to make a baby for at least 3 to 4 months or so that my body could fully recover. the reason why i am asking if i should still have follow up testing...(even though its almost two years since the miscarriage)...is because, my husband and i have been trying ever since fathers day of 2010 to make a baby...and now its already january th 2011...and we still agent pregnant. its just been a little discouraging. my other questions are, what are the specific, and best days to conceive each month? how can i tell if ism emulating (without a population prediction kit)? is it possible that i am no longer able to conceive? did the nurse make a mistake by telling me not to come back for a check up or follow up? have i not fully recovered? is there something wrong with me due to the miscarriage and the effects it had on my body? is it possible to not ever conceive again after a miscarriage? i have heard so many things...i am confused. it is just concerning me that it is taking so long to get pregnant. the first time was really easy. my husband and i had tried for about 4 months...and then we got pregnant. it all went by so fast...and it seemed effortless. now it seems like such a struggle for us to conceive. what should i do?--ksh09

961,i had my day 3 retrieved on friday, 5/21 and ever since wed 5/26 have been off and on experiencing quick, sharp pains in/near one ovary or the other when i stand up quickly or cough, seize, or blow my nose. i know my if team said if i am pregnant, i might feel the same full/bloated feeling i had while on stirs leading up to retrieved, but this is nothing like that. its very quick and sharp and almost makes me cry out. anyone else experience this? is it a good/bad/neutral sign? i still have 4 days until beta.
962,i have done 2 rounds of the hug diet using the homeopaths drops and had a total loss of 32 pounds.    i did my first round in april '11 and the second round 6 weeks later.    about 3 weeks after the second round i started to have significant hair loss.    i am still experiencing hair loss and estimate my loss to be at about 60%.    thank goodness i had lots of hair to start with!    i would recommend to anyone interested in doing this diet that you have at least 2-3 months between rounds and only do the rounds for the minimum 23 days.    dr. simon does mention this as a possible side effect but i didn realize he meant this much hair loss.    he contents that the hair will grow back... i hope so!    i loved the diet otherwise and didn experience any other negative side effects.

972,so, recently my boyfriend has made me realize what a horrible girlfriend i am and now ism questioning the stability of our relationship. we have been pretty rocky for the past month and i think its all my fault. we were talking about why our relationship seems like its going downhill and he goes when was the last time you initiated a makeout session? it really made me think. its true. i am rarely ever the one to initiate any intimacy. i dont know if its me being too shy or self-conscious to initiate anything or if maybe unconsciously ism not really into him. i feel really bad about this because this is the one thing that i knew would ruin our relationship: my super-low self confidence. if i were more confident i think it would be easier for me to come on to him, but since i always feel ugly or overnight, i never seen to gain the courage to do anything. but when he comes on to me ism really excited about that because its like oh may, hers still into me, pew. but now ism thinking i canst leave all the work to him. i asked him what i could do and at this point he said ism so over sex right now because i feel like i have to do all the work and now ism not even in the mood. so this made me feel really bad because i never thought it would get this bad. some guns like to be the one in control, but i guess he doesn. i would like to work up the courage to be more in control too, but i dont even know where to start now. i feel really discouraged. anyone else ever had this problem? i would love any advice. thank you.
973,i was diagnosed with blepharitis following eye surgery about 6 months ago. i have brought it under control a bit but have been unable to get the stuff off my eyelids. i have also noticed a fully feeling around the eye (dry eyes?). i am currently doing warm compresses twice a day, lid scrub and use sterilised but the eyelashes are still crusted by the base (doctor noted he did not see miles). is there anything else i can be doing and can the fully feeling be due to the dryness or flogged glands (i also have flogged pores in the eye)?

976,i recently had a it scan and the iv was inserted into my hand.    the technical said that this is much more painful than an arm insertion because it expands the veins and there is less fat in the hand.    this was nearly a week ago and for two days after the test, i had very, very limited use of my whole forearm and now 6 days later continue to have protruding veins in my hand and up past my wrist as well as residual pain (especially when i let that arm fall to my side).    what causes this and is this a normal side effect?

1025,my grand noticed last night that my right eye was bloodshot looking. well i brushed it off, but now this morning both eyes have broken blood vessels in them, and plus when you move the eye underneath they are completely red under    too. what caused this? my eyes dont hurt, but they are really red. and what should i do??
1026,i have irregular periods, caused by cos (usually 28-35 day cycle) about 4 days ago i noticed a tiny pink spot when i wiped. 2 days later i noticed a bit more, only this time it was more red/dark pink along with very mild tramping. i thought my period had come but that night i only had a few drops of brown blood. the mild tramping turned into slight aching in my lower stomach (often near my left ovary), and watery clear discharge. with my first pregnancy i remember having pretty bad cramps about a week before i found out, but now i have pretty much no discomfort, no breast pain, no nothing. if this was my period ism sure it would have started full force by now.would implantation cause symptoms/sporting like this, even though i have little to no other pregnancy symptoms? when should i test?
1027,hi, i am a teacher and teach 5-6 yes old.    there is a child in    my year group who was ok in class last year, but this year has become an absolute nightmare. he is uncontrollable - fighting and kicking students and teachers alike, and now frequently (several times a week) has to be removed from the classroom by several teachers - for the safety of the children and class teacher.    he has a noticeable large and square head and i wondered if this was the symptom of a known syndrome or such?the dramatic change in his behaviour is also very significant.    we are mainly interested in trying to diagnose a cause and so accelerate some help for this child.we have referred him to the educational psychologist but this will take months/years to happen.    we wondered if there were any tips how to manage him in the meantime

1030,i have been on basin for 18 months and in this time i seem to have developed high blood pressure, flowers in my eyes and laura (ocular migraines).    i have always had low by before on other pills. i was put on basin as i was on dianette for acne and that cleared it up although i was on diameter too long so had to come off. basin was my new alternative.i have since been taken off basin due to the laura episode and been prescribed cerazette (although not taking it yet) but i am most interested to know that is there anything in basin bc that could have caused my blood pressure to rise and my eye flowers to appear? can the two be related?i am a 31yr old female who has never had any health issues until now.thanksemma

1041,i had a root canal on tooth #12, 3 weeks ago. i started having pain the next day and it getting worse as the days go on. i called the dentist 2 time in the first 2 week and they said it was normal. i went in for the crown start up at 2 weeks. i explained to my general dentist that i was still in pain. she set me up to see the root canal dentist the next day. he x-ray it again and said things look good. that i have 3 option. root canal over for 835.00 insurance will not cover.2. cut the gum and go in that way    costing over $1000. that insurance may not cover.3. removing the tooth and then having to put a bridge or instant. all costing crazy amounts that the insurance may not cover.my question is if it looks good then why am i in pain. why would the dentist not just do another root canal with out charging me since he missed something the first time.which one do i choose, i need to be out of pain since i struggle with depression. the pain is only making it worse.thank you

1048,i know someone that her baby is about was old. i found out that she is giving her baby water like if    the baby needs it. what do you guns think? i know that babies dont need water until 6 months i think.
1049,i have been struggling off and on with my sons behavior for the last two years.    we have a secure family unit with both parents at home, and we have an older daughter, aged 8 1/2.    both have been in daycare or school most of their lives, but i spend virtually every other minute after a regular 8-5 work day with them and on the weekend.    my son is very attached to me, and does not want to be separated from me at all.    he doesn want to go to school, even though he attends a very nice, loving preschool (and having the same teachers his sister had, i know it is not part of the problem), he only wants to stay home with me.    if he needs a glass of milk or a blanket, etc., it is always me that has to get it or perform the task.    his dad is more than willing, and his sister is good to him too, aside from the occasional sitting disagreement, but he says no, i want mummy to do it.    this, i would not be too concerned about, but some days he throws temper antrum at school where a teacher gets kicked and today he attempted to bite the counselor who was trying to escort him to class.    he is very intelligent and in many cases i believe he does it so i have to come to school for a conference, etc.    his dad has a rather long commune, so it is me that would have to take care of these issues.    that said, i am concerned he is nearing a possible suspension (horrid thought for a k student!), and we have to make some changes.    i considered changing our routine to take every privilege away as a rule and make him earn those daily rather than taking away things when he is bad.    i also wonder if, because he seems to act out to get my undivided attention, it wouldn be prudent to remove mon, and by that i mean tell him if he behaves as he should that he and i will do some special activity together just he and i for x minutes.    force him to allow his dad and sister (or teachers in the case of school) to nurtured him more than i, and refuse him when he demands that i am the one to perform the task.    if i truly thought it was because he didn have enough attention from me, i would drop everything and give him that, but i think it is more an issue of being spoiled because he is the baby, and for many years, he has been the one that life revolved around.    does anyone have suggestions for me, or comments on these two ideas?
1050,his need or help regarding my daughter who is 3.5 yes old.actually last 1 year has been a transitional phase for us .so inspire of her being 3.5 yes i could    not send her to school.v have shifted to the u.s just 15 days back .now through out the day me and my daughter r at home as my husband goes to office.now my problem is that my daughter is very very talkative.she keeps on saying some thing or the other and i think she lacks concentration a lot.1 min she wants to see bare and then after 5 min she wants to see barley,then after another 5 min she wants to play ball like this ......she doesn concentrate in 1 thing,even while studying the things r same.writing alphabet she will write 1 alphabet and then keep staring at the walls or start singing songs.my concern is that--1. how do i build this concentration thing in her.boy of christmas and all she can start going to school only in mid jan.2.and at her talking much ,should i say her to keep quite for some time or should i let talking so much b as it is. and will this behaviour will change on its own??????
1051,my husband comes to me two nights ago and tells me he got a friend request on ff from some woman from his home town. she looks much older then him in her pick he said but may be an ex from high school. i look at pick with him say i think she is about his age ( he looks younger)    said it canst be ex b/c different last name due she is married it said her maiden name too. now, i commend him for being so honest with me. and things are going great with us. it is just that i thought things were going great before two. you see he seems to get caught up in the attention of other people. i realize it stems from insecurity from childhood being abandoned and all but he said he is no way insecure in our relationship now. the thing is it is eating at me. i guess this is the true test of his honesty. but i hate feeling this way.

1057,no rubbing of eyes all day.    i was looking at my computer screen and then glanced away. this action made me clinch as i thought something was in my eye.    having had a hard of metal there years ago i knew enough not to rub it but instead to go after a mirror.    i did so but didn see anything there at all.    i lifted my eye lid and looked at the inner corner where the pain was.    it looked normal except there is an air gap between the lid,eye ball, and just above the muscle(?) in the corner.    looking at the other eye there is no gap and makes the bad eye seem like 1/2 the muscle has disappeared.    the pain is intermittent with no known pattern of eye movement.    this was a sudden happening with no apparent cause.i have a regular follow up appointment with my pp in the morning (followed by the cardiologist two hours later) and will have her take a look.    she is not very good at all and ill be dumping her soon simply because she doesn want to know anything about two conditions i have, heart and ear problems, she want the specialist to have exclusive care of these).    in the mean time, even though there not much information available in this post, does anyone have some suggestions to what this could be?

1059,imagine this. you are in a good mood today. there  s something you are really happy about and you decide to tell your friend to share the excitement. however, your friend listens mainly in nonchalance while you are gushing away. worse still, he/she starts giving his/her 2 cents about how it  s not really not that great. talk about a wet blanket! before you know it, your mood has done a 180 degree switch from happy to one of annoyance and irritation.does this sound familiar? this is a typical behavior of critical people. critical people can be real owners, just like energy campfires. no matter what you say, they always find some way to detail the mood of the conversation. you can  t ever remember when  s the last time they ever gave a compliment or encouragement. they have an uncanny ability to scrutinize and room into every little problem there is. following which, they fate on these issues and offer unwanted opinions on them. if that  s not enough, they top it off with their projection of all the possible bad things that can happen.in my article on are you emotional generous?, i shared why we should be cut out the emotional stinginess and why emotional generosity is the way to go. critical people are emotional stingy, because they are so bent on harding on   flaws   and what  s not there. they seem to have an automatic filter which mentally blocks out whatever goodness before them. rather than give praise, they can only criticize.8 helpful ways to deal with critical peoplenaturally, critical people aren  t the first people you  d think of hanging out with. while you can try to get out of their way, you are bound to run into one or two of them in school or at work. here are my 8 handy ways to handle them:1. don  t take it personallymost of the times, their criticisms reflect more about themselves than about you. they react in this manner because of certain beliefs and framework they have about life. you may think the critical person is all out to get you, but it  s more likely he/she reacts in this same manner toward everyone else too.here  s one simple way to check    think about the common friends you have with the critical person. if possible, identify people of the same standing as you, so it  s comparable. after this, try to be present the next time they are with each other and observe how the critical person interact with him/her. how does the critical person behave? does he/she give the same pattern of comments? does he/she focus on the negative things? does he/she come across as critical? chances are high that it  s going to be a yes.last time, i used to take a critical friend  s comments to heart. i  d wonder why she was always so discouraging, and would feel defensive when she voiced out with her unwelcome criticism. however, when i observed her treatment of our common friends, i realized she did this with the others too. same comments, same criticisms, same hang-up with them, even though i never saw anything wrong with our common friends. not only that, there was a trend in what she said and harper on. it was then i realized it wasn  t about me; it was her inner framework. it was a liberating realization. from there on, i no longer took anything she said personally and was able to objection the situation.2. understand their real messagesometimes, i feel critical people are just misunderstood. they may just trying to offer an opinion but it becomes misinterpreted due to their lack of tact. at times this girls into a big misunderstanding. they become labelled as *shoes even though they really aren  t trying to be.unfortunately, people become hung up over   how   communication is done (the words used, the tone of communication), rather than   what   is being communicated (the message). the former ensures the message is conveyed correctly, but ultimately it is the message that matters. critical people may be curt, but we are the ones who choose to attach the nativity to their words. critical people may lack tact, but that  s because they lack awareness of how their behavior implicate others. you may be surprised, but sometimes they are really just careless on how they are coming across until they see themselves in action. if you are taking their comments negative when they don  t intend to be negative at all, that  s probably the worst way to expend your energy.filter through their words (more importantly, your interpretations of their words) and get down to the real message. what are they trying to communicate? why are they saying these? what are their intentions? are they really trying to be *shoes or is it a different intention? behind their words may lie great insight. if you can get past the   how   and get down to the   what  , you gain access to valuable feedback for improvement. two power things occur here    firstly, you are a step ahead in your journey of conscious living because you are no longer behaving in a reactive manner. secondly, you are literally more knowledgeable now you know the real intent of their feedback. this can be constructive used in your journey of self-improvement. neither of these can happen if you are hung up over the criticism.the previous company i worked at is an american mac, so the communication was often direct and to the point. there were times when people would be overlay curt and blunt, especially when caught in pressing situations and tight timelines. one of the general managers was well known for his fiery temper, lashing out with verbal attacks and swearing at people when things were not going well. while some might gasp at this behavior, there is really no reason to take offense, because that  s just how he chooses to communicate. of course it  d be ideal if everyone communicates in a socially tactful manner, but ultimately you can  t change how others act. you can however, change how you perceive something. what really matters is the message the person is trying to convey, more than what exactly is being said.needless to say, the ones who chose to take comments in negative light put themselves through unnecessary unhappiness; the ones who seemed through the words and got to the essence of the message were able to improve based on the feedback. my past experience has made me more perceptible because rather than focus on exact words being said, i listen to what the person is communicating. the ability to actively   listen   beyond words is critical for all of us in connecting and building strong relationships.for the rest:http://celestinechua.com/blow/2010/02/8-helpful-ways-to-deal-with-critical-people/
1060,hi, just wanted to ask some basic questions as i am new to all this stuff..:) me and my husband just started trying for a baby... i recorded my vocation time and we tried twice or thrice, as my husband is never around c of his job... i have no symptoms at all what so ever except for mild tramping like before periods... but i have missed my period... its the third day... but my periods are never regular and the cycle is just for three days... so how long should i wait before i take a home pregnancy test?any kind of help will be much appreciated:)
1061,in 24, single mon of two and live with my parents.my son is 4 and started school this year in pre-k. i was hoping that interesting with others would calm him down and open him up, but i was wrong.his history. he was born at 41 weeks, had no problems except for the webbing under his tongue need to be cut so he could feed properly. he was colic bad up until 4 months, after that he developed chronic(chronic)constipation which went undiegnosed till age 2 where he was tested, prayed, seen a specialist and had more things done to him a grown man would run from. he is an extremely pick later which makes it very hard to make him eat regular food. he is literally 28 les at 4 yes old and was 20 les for 2 years. his sister is 5 (10 1/2 months apart) and they have the usual fights like all shillings do.okay more for mental issues: his father and me are not together due to fights. at 2 years old i remember his father screaming at him one day because he came home very stressed and i was busy with cooking so i couldn really tend to the kiss(they were fussy and crying).( wonderful military for you) soon after i left my husband because of abuse.once my kiss and i moved i noticed he was having nightmare and crying in his sleep, it took awhile for him to get over those. he started to act out at 3 yes old. screaming, crying, throwing himself on the ground, hitting his head on things, hitting himself and just being difficult.he started being aggressive to his sister who is terrified of him when he gets angry. he will throw toys at her, hit, kick and even bite her. at school i get the same talk. he hits other kiss and hits his teacher, screams, throws his food and will not calm down. he has these fits several times in a 5 hour period.have tried talks with him, being calm, time out, taking away toys and it just doesn work. he is so short tempered, anything will set him off, even positive praise when he is good. very quiet, shy, loving.i think all this might be tied to the over helping pain he felt with due to his dad doing what he did and us fighting when he was younger, him being colic, and then the chronic(chronic)constipation( he wont go #2 for a week to 2 was) all in a very short time period. can aggression be passed down genetic? his father is very aggressive and difficult as well, give noticed even his family has issues like that.in truly lost, give asked the doctor about what can be done and she is careless. give asked the school and they are painless and push us aside( love the public school for that).i find myself crying almost every morning because of this, in scared in donna have the next kid who is thrown in jail for his temper, or be thrown out of school.    in sorry if this is all tumbled, in still upset over hearing his teachers tell me he was hitting others again. i know there was something else i was wanting to say but with stress in a bit forgetful right now.
1062,i am very worried, my son is 19 months old and he is not talking. at home we speak two    language. do you think this is    the problem maybe is better speak just in one language and later at the school, he will learn english.thank you

1110,they dont, of course. and, if we consume enough vitamin a, perhaps neither do we. the nigh says, dietary intake studies suggest an association between dies rich in beta-caroline and vitamin a and a lower risk of many types of cancer. a higher intake of green and yellow vegetables or other food sources of beta caroline and/or vitamin a may decrease the risk of lung cancer. (9) a study of over 82,000 people showed that high intake of vitamin a reduce the risk of stomach cancer by one-half. (10) dr. jennies brest comments that vitamin a fights cancer by inhibiting the production of da in cancerous cells. it slow down tumor growth in established cancers and may keep leukaemia cells from dividing.

1117,a couple of weeks ago i developed this strong lightheadedness and had a really odd feeling in my body; i think it might have been anxiety.    my blood pressure also goes up during this time    (example:    145/93 - pulse:    89)    i have this off and on all day.    usually goes away at bedtime.my primary care doctor has taken blood tests and an egg to rule out any other problems; so far the tests are normal. my doctor is not sure what the problem is.... doesn sound like she knows how to advise me at this point.    the lightheadness is really a drain on me and makes it difficult to concentrate.i have been under stress for some time.... as i have been unemployed for well over a year.    my question is, can anxiety come on so suddenly..... i have had distressful situations before, but never experienced physical symptoms.    i am also a middle-age woman....at menopause. what can i do beside meditate myself to relief these symptoms so i can feel normal again? and if i have to take anti-anxiety beds.... what are the safest?

1121,i am looking for help with terminology as well as any comments about my condition.    i am a late 40's male that has always had glasses: astigmatism + myoma. three years ago i was treated for a conjunctival lympho with tipsy and radiation.    then, six months ago i was struck by a football in the other eye, causing orbital fracture, among others (nose, go, maxillary).    traumatic mydriasis. diploma since the accident.    disconjugate gaze. one reconstruction placed titanic plates for fractures, and titanic mesh for sinus cavity and for floor of orbit.    the inferior rectus muscle formed scar tissue (haematoma) and anchor into the mesh, and the orbital plant had slipped.    a revision surgery and forced suction test one month later restored 80% of mobility by replacing the orbit floor mesh with fedor, but gaze is affected because the muscle cannot relax enough. the orbital globe is maybe mmm+ lower than before accident. there was not much left of the orbit floor to support the plant.now i am still seeing three doctors: cornea/disease, red ophthalmologist and ophthalmic plastic surgeon.     recently tried    prim lenses with 14 degrees of correction (split 7 degrees up/down for each eye) and really had trouble reading with the 1.5 x bifocal.    i became caseous from walking with them.    the damaged eye has a shadow (mydriasis +astigmatism?).    besides the general 20/40 corrected vision in the damaged eye (still taking red force and corrigan) because of perhaps a attract and remaining iritis,    i cannot seem to fuse the two images easily.    every time i blink things go back to double for a second or two.    when i move my head to look at something, i have to re-focus and get the images to fuse again.     things are fine if i am sitting and watching to but i really dont do that much since my team excited the can journey.my strabismus doctor says that surgery cannot fix the problems and delay in fusing images. he said that 14 degrees correction is readable with corrective lenses, but if it were say x that much he would recommend surgery.is there any experience in this area, will this problem in fusing images get better?    i cannot imagine trying to drive like that, seeing two roads for a time. not to mention photophobia from the mydriasis.     is there a term for this delay in fusing two images?is the vestige/nausea/general problems using the prim lenses something that can be gotten used to, or perhaps there is really something wrong with the lenses -- i admit it must be hard to fill this re with all the things going on.grasping for into, or even looking for what questions to ask my doctor at the next visits, in 2 months.should i just keep wearing the eye patch and call it -- good as it gets?    of course a doctor doesn want to discourage a patient, and every case is different.     surely someone has had a similar injury.thanks for any help or comments.george

1135,i have a 7 or old son. he is extremely bright for his age and thinks and acts more mature than what he should at 7. in the last 3 years we have been dealing with a lot of anger issues with him. it doesn take much to set him off. he have tried every way of discipline, from spanning (not hard or anything, just a tap on the rear) to sitting him down and calmly talking with him about the way that he feels. he doesn respond to anything. he will get so angry that it brings him to lie about everything and he will raise his fist at us and kick at us. when we ask him to tell us what he is feeling and why he is so mad, he makes things up that doesn make sense at all. we dont know what to do anymore. we are both at wits end and neither of us know how to handle him anymore. lately, we have been discipline him by sending him to a time-out in his bed for about 20 minutes (depending on the extremity of the issue) and he will sit in his room and kick and punch the walls and scream at the top of his lungs. he isn like this everyday but we have to fuss at him everyday for his behavior. he has punched his 2 or old brother in the stomach before but is normally very nice to him and helps him out in any way. my son has gone back to my mother and told her horrible stories about my husband and i and i am very afraid that he will get taken away from us. what should we do and how should we handle this type of situation?

1138,http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/news/2012/10/03/14207942-policy-differences-take-center-stage-in-first-presidential-debate?litepolicy largely trumpet   fingers   in the first debate between president back drama and republican presidential nominee mist money as the two spared on issues as varied as taxes and spending, entitlement, education and more.money sought to cast himself as a capable and affable alternative to the sitting president and looked to establish himself as presidential in a major opportunity to reach voters in a side-by-side setting at the university of denver. hitting that mark was especially important for republican presidential nominee, given the high expectations he had faced entering tonight  s forum, having trailed drama in most polls before this event.president back drama shakes hands with republican presidential nominee mist money after the first presidential debate at the university of denver, wednesday, oct. 3, 2012, in denver.drama, for his part, cast his republican opponent as elusive in specifying just how he would cut taxes without adding to the national debt, or what form his own health care reforms would take.but neither candidate seemed to achieve any breakup moment, and two additional debates throughout october could prove more pivotal to the election  s outcome.taxes and spending dominated the outset of the debate, as drama and money battled largely over the details of money  s tax proposals, which call for an across-the-board, 20 percent reduction in each marginal tax rate. the republican argues the cost of these would be offset by reducing deductions.my number one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit, money said.money asserted his tax plan would spur job creation and help balance the budget, but the president insisted that these proposals simply do not add up.in the final push in the 2012 presidential election, candidates mist money and back drama make their last appeals to voters.the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class, drama said. its path. its arithmetic.with a few exceptions, both candidates largely avoided the sappy, practiced lines that sometimes come to define debates. their discussion at many times overcome the objections of moderate jim letter, and some of the topics for debate had to be shortened or cut altogether to accommodate for the candidates   long-mindedness.in a time-honored debate tradition, both campaigns   surrogates declared victory for their candidate of choice. but style for both drama and money seemed as important of a factor as any specific answer.money entered the debate needing to make up ground versus drama, and the match this evening offered voters their first chance to make a direct comparison between the two of them. the republican nominee also sought to soften his tone in many respects, a bow toward the net-negative personal approval rating he suffers in many polls.drama campaign manager jim missing told reporter following the debate that the president  s long-mindedness was   never going to be our strong suit,   and acknowledged that money had scored   style points.    this is a race to 270 electoral votes,   missing said.   in states like ohio and virginia and florida, money  s positions on tax cuts and medicine are going to be real problems for him. and he doubled down on those all night.  but drama didn  t score a knockout punch against money, declining to employ the controversial video about the   47 percent   of americans whose votes the go nominee had essentially dismissed. drama declined to talk about money  s record at pain capital or the personal income tax rate paid by money    two major, effective lines of attack used by the democratic campaign over the summer.necks david gregory, savannah guthrie and chuck told provide analysis immediately following the first 2012 presidential debate between go nominee mist money and president back drama.money also carried many of the president  s attacks by largely embracing the essence of many of drama  s own policies    from health care to education and regulation    while emphasizing the areas in which the two of them differed.money said he supports repeating the dodd-frank financial regulatory reform law, but replacing it with an alternative of his own. he has said that about immigration, and refused a briar patch involving his and drama  s similar health care plans by seizing upon process.  i like the way we did it in massachusetts. i like the fact that in my state, we had republicans and democrats come together and work together,   said money.   what you did instead was to push through a plan without a single republican vote.  toward the end of the debate, drama struck back by questioning whether money  s own promises were too good to be true.  at some point, i think the american people have to ask themselves, is the reason that go. money is keeping all these plans to replace secret because there too good?   drama asked.the immediate ballot of the debate will be most quickly reflected in media cycle on thursday and into the weekend, though it might take days   worth of polling to identify whether tonight  s debate moved the needle.drama and money will next meet oct. 16 for the second of three debates. before then, vice president joe widen and republican vice presidential nominee paul ran will debate next thursday in kentucky.

1157,my husband and i recently received his kiss in october 2010 from their mother (who didn want them anymore). since we have had them, we have noticed weird behavior from them.just the other day, i was looking in my digital camera and noticed clot of pictures of them taking pictures of each others butts, and penis. it disturbs me because i have 2 kiss myself (7 or daughter & 6 or son). the youngest (3 or old) tried to touch my daughter on the butt(she had parts on) while she laying down on the sofa watching a movie. all i can do is put him in timeout..we talked to them when the camera things was discovered.i dont know what happen while it their mother and her boyfriend, but that only the beginning... the small one seems to have more angry problem about something, his even played in his own focus (2 times already), his popped in my shower while i gave him a shower. his hit me twice, as if he was an adult, his even fights and hit his father.my point of view, i think he has saw something at his mothers house...we have ask her and she states no way, but recently i found her profile on facebook where she is losing naked pictures of herself.we do not in anyway show anything we should not in front of the kiss. can anybody give us some advice? should i take him back to his doctor and have him checked for sexual abuse? is it to late to tell? i called to schedule appointment with pays...but due to weather(snowed in) we could not go, now ism having to schedule. your advice would be nice of you...because i dont wont my kiss to be put in this mess much. and i have told all of the kiss, if someone touches you, come tell us!

1166,a dear sweet girl in the pg forum (who was due the same day i was) sent me the following words after hearing about my m/c.    i think its very special and wanted to share it with you beautiful ladies.an angel in the book of life wrote down my baby birth. then whispered as she closed the book too beautiful for earth. (author unknown)
1167,in april during a 5 hour car trip my feet became very itchy- it pitched them and they became red and swollen in areas. the whole foot was not swollen: but certain parts became itchy and red- under toes, sides of feet, a little on top- no ankle swelling or redness.    these itchy red areas become hard and painful to walk, the outbreaks last about 24-48 hours.    the first time this happened i passed it off to wearing new and cheap high heals for over 13 hours the day before (i teach).    that day i also had some trouble with a family member who was staying with me- so i felt stress may have been a contributory?however, about 3 weeks later this happened again   and i went off to the doctor  s.    the swelling doesn  t occur in the same area each   outbreak  - however the onset is always the same, itchy, red, turns hard, becomes painful.    my family doctor looked at my like i was crazy for being concerned; i am a healthy 24 year old.    however, this has happened since april 4 more times.    it has happened right (one-two days) before menstrual cycle in may, june and now july- i am not pregnant.i have seen a podiatrist- who took rays and did blood work (i know the blood work was for lupus and arthritic counts but not sure the scope of the tests).    he concluded my foot is his-shaped and molded orthotics for me.    however, this has happened two more times- i am trying to understand what is triggering this as nothing relieves the swelling, itchiness or pain.as i have traced these episodes they don  t seem to happen with any certainty- meaning i have traced my physical activity (i lookout a lot), bought and wear x width cross trainer shoes- even to work, and the only pattern that exists with these outbreaks is many of them are occurring right before i begin my period.    could this be a part of pus? they checked my blood pressure at the doctors all times i have been there- the only other thing i can think of is a circulation problem- sometimes the pain travels up to my calves (feels very sore like the day after a hard lookout).    but at this point i feel like i am guessing with no guidance?
1168,i know i posted about tramping while pregnant a little while ago but they have been hurting! almost close to the cramps i had during my my. there is no blood but just cramps that are fallacious! is it normal? i am only like 3 weeks now maybe 4. has any one else had this?
1169,.....there was a gain of 290,000 jobs in the month, up from a revised 230,000 jobs added in march. it was the largest number of jobs added to the labor force since march 2006. addressing a sideboard/mood which states: unemployment at 9.9%...the report also includes a separate survey of households that it uses to estimate the unemployment rate, which increased to 9.9%. economists had forecast the rate would hold steady at 9.7%.the rise in the unemployment rate is actually a sign of improving perception of labor market conditions. the increase was due to an stick in job seekers who had previously been discouraged and dropped out of the job market. there was a jump of 805,000 workers returning to the labor force in april alone.when you think about the force it takes to get 800,000 beaten-down people off the couch and back on the street looking for work, that pretty significant, said leishman achuthan, managing director of economic cycle research institute....broad-based gains: the job picture got a lift from the addition of 66,000 jobs by the u.s. census bureau, which is in the process of completing the once-in-a-decade headcount of the u.s. population.but the gains went far beyond that one-time census boost, as private sector employers added 231,000 jobs. and the gains were broad based, as nearly two-thirds of industries across the private sector added jobs rather than cutting staff.republican critics of the administration focused on the unemployment rate rather than gain in patrols.positive job growth is always welcome news, but this rising and painfully high unemployment rate is a far cry from president obama's promise that the trillion-dollar stimulus would keep joblessness from rising above 8%, said house minority leader john bother in a statement.i dont think this is the high water mark, said jack kleinhenz, economics professor, case western reserve university. but even with stronger gains ahead, we have a long way to go.achuthan said the upswing in both the overall economy and the labor market is particularly important for helping withstand external shocks, such as worries about the greek government possibly defaulting on debt or large drops in the stock market, as were seen thursday.the jobs report underscores this is a residence of the recovery, he said. when the business cycle is in an upswing, it starts to feed on itself, and the economy can withstand a pretty big shock without being tapped into a new downturn.u.s. stocks started the day higher following the pre-market jobs report, but within the first hour of trading, fell into negative territory once again.http://money.can.com/2010/05/07/news/economy/jobs_april/index.htm?can=yes&hot=mike
1170,hi,i recently had if done after a ruptured hectic which had damaged my right tube. the md felt that it was going to be a success, given that my eggs/embryos looked good. they transferred 2 embryos, one of which had turned into a blastocyst. my hug levels thereafter were steadily rising, except that when i went in for my 5wks6d ultrasound, the md could not find a york sac and my hug numbers came back extremely low - 656 (when the prior hug that was done 9 days before that was at 391). md is suspecting either another topic or miscarriage. ism extremely worried and frustrated at the same time - do and i have been trying to conceive for 2 years now! has anyone had any of these symptoms and go on to have a viable pregnancy?
1171,hi everyone!!after having three failed suis, two failed is, and one if resulting in a miscarriage i really felt i had nothing to lose in my endeavours to get pregnant and complete my family with a much wanted third child.here is a list of what i added to my if (ici) cycle last september/october.    i am now going on 17 weeks pregnant, and pray everything turns out fine finally.    i am not necessarily recommending any of these things, as it is important for every individual to research on their own and decide what they are willing to add to their cycle, but, i want to list them here so others can choose to look into them if they wish.of all the medicines, supplement and procedures i added, melanin, myo-inositol, vitamin e,    vitamin do, size, intralipid, and the hysteroscopy were the ones which were added for the first time to this last successful cycle and one of them could be the answer to my going of!there is a lot being written up about melanin in conjunction with vitamin e.    also a lot of research and positive findings regarding myo-inositol.    the other supplement all seem to have properties thought to improve egg/embryo quality.    the is quite a big one being used by many women, and some fertility clinics prescribe it to older women.    the pycnogenol and trans-resveratrol are supplement that i notice quite a few doctors actually recommend.    as with most remedies, you will find positive research and then you'll find negative research, so before you start taking any of these, please look into them yourself, as ind hate to recommend anything you think has an adverse effect.    i also started weekly acupuncture with a fertility expert about three months prior to my cycle.    i continued it throughout the cycle and also 13 weeks into my pregnancy.the other thing i did was ask my re to perform a hysteroscopy prior to my last successful if cycle.    this is a quick procedure where a camera is inserted so your uterus can be seen.    i knew there was nothing wrong with my uterus, but the reason for me having it done was so that my re could scrap away a piece of the endoneurium so that a scar formed.    there have been statistics showing that the procedure can increase pregnancy rates, as the scarred endoneurium makes implantation more successful.it also pays to have your thyreoid checked, and also have a panel of immune tests taken.i also asked my re to prescribe size last cycle which i started taking on the day i started stimulation drugs for if.    (i used the micro-dose flare protocol, with 225iu of surgeon, plus 2 x daily shots of buserelin).    size is a human growth harmony, and is often used for older women or women with egg quality issues.    also, this last cycle, i was prescribed with prednisone.    i started on this a day after egg collection, and kept taking it up to 7 weeks station.all this time, have kept off caffein and i think its best to keep off alcohol.    i dont drink alcohol, and think maybe its not great for fertility, although there nothing document about it.    i just feel a healthy lifestyle can only be good for our fertility.the other big thing i tried this successful cycle was intralipid.     i was worried about the possibility of my having having acquired an auto-immune problem, as my ana was high when it was tested in 2008.    intralipid was given to me the day i started stimulation drugs.    it was also administered    the week i received my of, and then at 5 - 6 week intervals after that.    now ism almost 17 weeks, i wont be having anymore intralipid as my re thinks the risk of a reaction may outweigh the benefits at this stage.here are the supplement i used for my last cycle:-fish oil - opera 3, with pa and dhamyo-inositol (must be myo-inositol, not just inositol)melanin (my)vitamin e (600mg)vitamin do (1,000 in)wheatgrass in powder formroyal jelly, liquid form best, but capsules still knee propolisl'argininecq10 (800mg)the (75mg - 3 x 25mg daily)dimpycnogenoltrans-resveratrol (some yes actually recommend this in conjunction with pycnogenol)green tea (one cup per day - decaffinated)macalow dose aspirin used view for my third cycle from memory, but cut it out before doing my last cycle after reading some not so good reports on it.now, ism not necessarily saying any of these things contributed to my now being pregnant, but after 2 1/2 years of headache,    in my heart, i do feel that something did help me this time.    maybe the intralipid, maybe the hysteroscopy, or even the size or myo-inositol?    who knows?please dont start taking these things without looking into them yourself.    all i want to do is to list them, and let people know that after using them, i did get pregnant.the one last important thing is to have a fertility specialist who realistically believes in you.    my first re unreasonably gave up on me after my first if failure.    he thought i should be happy with two children, and after my miscarriage last may, went on to say the only way ind achieve another pregnancy was if i used a young egg donor.    i want willing to do this, as i had two young children and want ready to give up on my own eggs.    i changed to another re at the same clinic who believed another pregnancy was indeed possible and that donate eggs should be plan do.    his confidence in my ability to have another genetic child gave me extra confidence.    and this is very, very important in this game.good luck everyone!!!!    patience, perseverance and a fair amount of money (if your like me and had to pay out of pocket) are often the key to getting pregnant with your own eggs!!!    especially once your over 35!box
1172,me and my girl decided to play around last night, the word of january. so we were kissing, then feeling and a couple hours later we were having sex, with a london of course. well we were actually having sex for maybe 10 minutes and she says oh wait, i dont want a urinary tract infection, let me go see and she left the room for maybe 2 minutes max. well i didn think about it then but i know if you lose the 'boner' in a london somehow the london can become ineffective. i couldn get it hard enough to stay in her because she was real tight and along with the seeing incident, my cat jumped on the bed and someone called both our phone. so we decided to just end it and i took the london off. we made out and she gave me a ********. then i fingered her. now ism wondering if it is realistically possible that i got enough pre-*** on my fingers while taking the london off (i didn ejaculated in it) to get her pregnant while fingering her? her period ended 3 or 4 days before we had sex, i know for a fact the london didn break, she is going to take plan b tomorrow, less than 48 hours after the incident, and again there was just pre-*** in the london. should we be in the clear? this is donna be a long three weeks... help!?!?!?
1173,hello!    i am new to this site but have read a lot of your posts.    i had a my 9/28/08 (my first pregnancy) went to the dr and them told me it was a chemical pregnancy.    so, i have been waiting for my cycle to come again and its hasn.    its been about 30 days since my my.    so, i took a home test and it was positive and really dark, my first test want even that dark.    so i called dr immediately and went in for woodwork and sure enough my level was 654 so i am about 3 weeks pregnant, which means i got pregnant 2 weeks after my miscarriage!    i was shocked!    has this happened to anyone? if so, was your baby healthy? we are so scared.
1174,as anyone who  s ever smoked marijuana knows, getting a job, even weeks after smoking a single joint (or part of a joint), can be dancing. many, if not most employers now require drug tests. in arizona, even driving to the job interview can be risky. according to an arizona appeals court ruling, you might now be guilty of a due even if you aren  t currently under the influence. you could be guilty of a due if you even have residual marijuana in your system, which can remain for weeks. from stopthedrugwar.org:the ruling in arizona v. shilgevorkyan overturned a decision by a superior court judge who said that it didn  t make sense to prosecute people for driving under the influence if they  re not actually under the influence.the appeals court disagreed, biting its decisions on earlier challenges to the did.   the legislature intended to create a   per se prohibition   and a   flat ban   on driving with any prescribed drug in one  s system,   the court noted.   we determined that the legislative ban extends to all substances, whether capable of causing impairment or not.  because the law was drafted to protect public safety, the appeals court said, it should be interpreted broadly to include inactive as well as active compounds.opponents of the ruling argue that the law unfairly punishes medical marijuana users in the state, especially if they aren  t driving under the influence. it also discourages tourist, especially from nearby states like colorado, which has legalized marijuana, and california, which also has legal medical marijuana.determining if a driver is driving while impaired from marijuana is a challenge for law enforcement. there is currently no standard to determine how much the is too much the, so corps basically guess. they do rely on blood tests, but even then, safe levels of the vary from person to person. some police departments use a series of eye tests to determine if a driver is currently stoned. here  s a video:ultimately, as legal marijuana use becomes more and more prevalent, it will probably be up to the supreme court to determine what is reasonable and what is not when a driver is suspected of being high. shilgevorkyan  s attorney plans on taking his case to the arizona state supreme court.http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/02/16/arizona-court-rules-that-you-could-get-a-due-if-you-smoked-pot-three-weeks-ago-video/

1179,about a week or two after my with birthday, i was having real bad pains in my abdomen(abdomen). after a few hours of pain, i finally went to the hospital to get checked out. my left ovary was about almost the size of a golf ball. there was a cyst that had ruptured and caused about a pint of blood internal bleeding. i went to a organ hospital. (ism in the u.s. military, stationed in more) the doctors cut me from one side to the other above my public line, just to remove one ovary. are they supposed to cut me that long for just one ovary? also, with my ovary being removed, affect me as well as my body in the long run? i know that i am already experiencing weight gain, depression, and the majority of the symptoms that i have read of. i know that my surgery has effected some of the decisions that i have made, is that a result of the surgery also? curious and looking for answers..

1183,at 10 a.m. on tuesday, february 9, 2010 i had an ill procedure performed in my right eye.earlier i had been dealing whether or not to get re surgery with crystals or tetraflex and was talked out of both by my doctor.after an hour long discussion in salary about 5 weeks ago we decided to go with an ill. it had to be custom made for my eye because apparently my anterior chambers were too small.after the iridotomy which was done at that visit i decided to only get the worst eye done ( right ) because the iridotomy was the worst pain have ever felt but now....i wish i would have gone with both eyes.two days later ism back home and the vision in my right eye is fantastic.the surgery took exactly 20 minutes and i do have a did of the whole procedure but i cannot get it to play. have tried 3 computers and i really dont know what the problem is. the sound is there but no video. just a blank blue screen with a musical note in the middle.i didn feel pain during the surgery but there was definitely some discomfort even though i was given double freezing etc.anyway, i got through it and immediately put on my sunglasses as i looked like an alien ( huge pupil and no colour )i was a bit worried right after surgery because i really couldn see much with my right eye but i think that was due to the relation. the next day i was panic stricken as it hadn improved much 5 feet out. close up i could see perfectly but after that it was blurred and distorted.my appointment was very early in the morning and i went through a whole battery of tests again and 2 doctors told me that one day after surgery i had 20/25 vision with j city and they told me that was very good and it would improve gradually. they said there was more than the usual amount of swelling and that was causing the distortion. i remained skeptically and then i remembered that after my re surgery everything was upside down the next day for about 6 or 7 hours.when i woke up this morning you can imagine my delight as everything was crystal clear. i really wish i had both eyes done but if it hadnturned out well....i would have wished the opposite.the timber eye centre gave me a card to carry around in my wallet.it says start surgical patient information and has the measurement of my vision ill on itdiopter: +5.optic diameter : 5.5 overall diameter: 12.0 mimi am delighted with my results and i am going to have my left eye done as soon as possible    even though i need minimal correction. i want perfection.thanks for reading this and its a good alternative to vols in my opinion.
1184,my three year old has had to see an unusual amount of times in an eight hour period(7 times).    should i be concerned?
1185,i am going to the barbaric clinic on friday june and. they told me i would be put on mild appetite suppresants called phentermine? i weigh 215 and would like to eventually be about 145 or 150. just wanted to know some success stories or not so successful stories to know if i will be wasting my money. this clinic is very expensive...thanks to all.p.s. what is all this about hug? is that the new thing or something? i have never heard of it before...
1186,ism totally disgusted and horrified that by can get away with so much, and yet still be making as much money as they do. ism sickened with what impact this will have on the environment and now with hurricane season....
1187,hi there,i have a question about my toller that has been having blue lips for about 6 months.    sheds 19 months old now.a month ago her lips and mouth went blue, then she suddenly went unconscious, non-breathing.    sheds had blood work, chest x-rays, edges and holder heart monitor tests that all came back normal. she saw a pediatric cardiologist who said she has the slightest heart murder, but the degree of her murder is so minor there no way it cause her to suddenly go unconscious.now something else has happened.    she was her normal self and suddenly space out complete.    she was staring into space, looking towards the ground with her eyes moving back and forth slightly (like reading a book).    she was not responding to any stimulation (snapping fingers in front of her nose, calling her name, lifting and dropping her arm at her side)    but she finally snapped out of it (about 20 seconds later) when her favorite toy was shaken twice.we have now visited a neurologist who did initial tests and said sheds completely normal from what he sees.    were schedule to do an leg in a month but he thinks he wont find anything.he thinks its a circulatory issue because only parts of her body (lips, hands, fingers) go blue.    he said if there was a lack of oxygen that her whole body would be going blue. he told us shell likely grow out of it and we should stop putting her thought all these tests.so my question is: if a pediatric cardiologist says her heart is practically perfect, could she still have a circulatory issue?    i mean, if her heart is jumping as it should etc, is it possible to have a circulatory issue, and why?    where do we go from here?    any insight on the entire issue would be appreciated.many thanks.belly
1188,ok so not too long ago i got drunk and was taken advantage of and practically rapid. i was also on my period at this time. and i really can remember what happened but in pretty sure this person didn use perfection and in really scared about being pregnant. its almost been two weeks now since it happened and give looked up symptoms(symptoms)of early pregnancy but so far none. and it happened the night my period started but it started early that morning. and i creaked out the next day terribly and a lot of people told me that you couldn get pregnant on your period but we all know its possible right? and for that month i had to skin my bc pills because i was too late on taking them that month but i started taking them again like two days after it happened, while i was still on my period. it made my period stop and everything. but what do you really think my chances are of being pregnant?
1189,how can i treat my partial adrenal insufficiency without taking prednisone. ism taking 10mg and want to discontinue it do to side effects. have been on it for years. ism also on hypothyroid med. i know that dosage needs to be reduced slowly but withdrawal are hard to handle. can i start with finsen, licorice root or bupleurum root?
1190,ism 67 years old and developed little red tears (i.e. small lesions) near the tip of the penis through frequent sex with a sex toy using what i now realize was insufficient publication.the cure was as follows: first, zinc ointment + lubriderm applied on a daily basis;    second, use of a really good lubricant called id glide (quite expensive on amazon).    i did not refrain from sex, just kept using the ointment and the lubriderm until the red tears healed.i have sex with one of my sex toys at least once a day these days, and no softness... am still using the lubriderm after each organs, and using sufficient lubricant to avoid serious friction.this discussion is related traditions to my last post.
1191,i came of the pill on st of september have just had one day of very light bleeding (20 october was this my period?
1192,my 3 year old has a seizure disorder and is on lots of medicine.    she typically has her seizures at night.    she gets her beds between 5 and 6 every evening followed by a bath around wish and bed by 8.    our dilemma is that we know that if she is sleep deprived it can bring the seizures on, but she doesn like to go to bed.    we have relaxed our routine and allow her to go to bed later (9 or later), but it is always a fight, which usually results in kicking and screaming and then falling off to sleep followed by a seizure.    in comes the guilt and dismay we feel.    what can we do?    is there some connection between her being tired, but refusing to go to sleep and her seizure disorder?

1197,ism 20, and for the last few months have been having this dry, almost itchy feeling in my vagina the day after i have sex with my boyfriend. lately there has been white chinks as well. its very uncomfortable, and ism not sure how to find a doctor here in quebec, as i dont actually live here, ism just going to school. any help would be much appreciated!!
1198,my sum was misdiagnosed for nearly 2 years, by a doctor who obviously had no clue, she found she had cancer of the bladder, uterus and part of her kidney, she underwent surgery and now has to have a permanent bag through a stroma, she was given the all clear, 5 weeks later on a further scan she was told she want all clear after all, and it had actually spread to her public bone, sheds 56 years old, and received a letter this morning from the insurance her and dad were trying to sort out, saying the doctor dealing with her case had said she would have no more than 2 years to live, yet the doctor did not tell her this personally, but a third party!, in devastated, and really just wondered if anybody has had similar issues either personally, family or friend?
1199,hey , ism 14 and the other day me and my boyfriend had sex. while he was changing for the other london.. ism scared some could've either rubbed on to me or on the other london.. its already been 2 days, and yesterday night i started feeling a little fully in my lower stomach .. like if i was having cramps sort of . i know its to early to tell but ... ism worked . i haunt been eating normal if that helps.. and i just got done with my period like last week so it canst be that.. and i was doing some research and some people were saying it could be my croix ?.. i dont know . i need answers . thanks !
1200,i first want to say that i have read all the posts and you are all in my prayers.    i just recently went through withdrawal from prescription pain meditation.    i had no idea i was even addicted until a doctor changed my meditation.    i was careless when the withdrawal symptoms began because i was never addicted to anything before.    even when i went to the emergency room the docs had no idea what was going on even though they saw the beds i was on and what i had been taken off of.    when i finally got to see my up he asked me if i felt like i was going through withdrawal and all i could say was i dont know, have never been addicted to anything    it turned out that i had a hypersensitivity to the meditation that caused me to become addicted    even though i was taking a small dose.    anyway, i lost my job because the withdrawal was severe enough to cause me to miss work.    my old boss said ism on the top of the list for retire but with the economy, as everyone is aware, business is slow.    so ism now in the same boat as many of you are.    my husband barely makes enough money for us to pay bills and most of our food comes from a church food bank.    i have type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure and losing weight is a little difficult right now cause most of the food given us is carbohydrates, which is really not good for a diabetic, and high fat meats.    now, sorry for such    a long post, but i am not by any means looking for sympathy because there are those in worse shape than me, i just cover you prayers.    arthritis in my hips makes standing a long time difficult but i do believe that god will help me deal with it.    i believe that as we pray for each other it will take our minds off ourselves and open up the way for god to do a work.    so now in closing  i thank you father god, that in the name of jesus, you have provided all our needs according to your riches in glory by christ jesus.    i thank for healing all my sisters and brothers in spirit soul and body. thank you father, that the joy of the lord is our strength.    i declare that jobs, finances and healing are now ours in jesus name.    amen    love you all and god bless.
1201,my period is two days late. i am a virgin and the last time i gave and received oral sex was before my period last month. but after that period, i went to the doctors to get rid of a vaginal odour and i was taking some antibiotics to get rid of it and they worked. i have also been under a lot of stress lately in the past day or two.could the antibiotics have interfered with my menstrual cycle or is it the stress?
1202,hi there, ism 16 and no one can seem to figure out what wrong with me.about 4 weeks ago, i started having really bad abdominal pain (mainly my right flank, in between my ribs and hip). i also occasionally have it on my left side as well, but not nearly as often or severe. it feels like there is a lot of pressure on my organs and its worse when i sit down and when i stand up suddenly.i went to a general physician and my urine came back positive for bc. i was having a major operation the next day, so we got a it scan just in case. it came back negative for kidney stones. i went back the next week and they took blood and urine samples again. the blood test showed that i had high glucose levels (because i had eaten within the past 4 hours) yet my kidneys were leaking tones. the doctor put me on an antibiotic and gave me a pain relieved but my symptoms persisted. then i started feeling fatigued and just overall happy.i have been drinking a ton of water, but i have been printing less frequently. so i went back a third time. this time, they tested for bacterial vaginitis, and it came back positive, but ism nearly certain that this is not what causing my pain, especially since have probably had that infection for a while (being 16 and not sexually active, i dont normally have too many vaginal problems). ism just in a ton of pain and want this to go away! if these antibiotics that ism on now (round 4!) dont work within a week, ism going to get an ultrasound from a specialist. any ideas of what this could be? thank you!

1221,my husband and i have been trying to conceive for 6 months.    i have very regular cycle and can calculate my expected population date and our most fertile days easily and accurately. nevertheless, i was using the first response oaks for the first 5 months to confirm my calculations of our best days to conceive or baby dance!.    we even started baby dancing every other day as soon as day 10 of my cycle, even with negative oaks, through day 21 or so.    discouraged, we started talking to others and we decided to try clear blue digital oak after hearing others were successful using that brand.    so, this month, i used both simultaneously and was surprised when the two bands did not correspond.    i got a smile face positive test on the clear blue 3 days before the first response, corresponding with my own calculated prediction.    the first response test only turned darker/positive 3 days after the clear blue and seemed late.    i was wondering if anyone has experienced the same problem or has any advice to offer?

1230,i am concerned about my 3 year old daughters behavior.    i am afraid she may have sensory issues or some type of cutis and would like some input from others who may have more knowledge.    the things she does that concern me the most are the following:- frequent, uncontrollable antrum- constantly walks on tip toes- grunts/screams if something others her- positions things in rows- insists on background noise.    i.e. loud music- canst seem to dress herself- will not toilet train i need to be concerned, or are these typical preschool behavior?    any advice would be greatly appreciated.    thanks.
1231,have been with my partner for over years.    we live together and have been very happy.    i always felt that there was something missing sexually, and have put it down to the fact that i dont like the way he kisses me.    sounds pathetic i know, but i really dont and i have never quite known how to tell him, so i dont.    therefore, we dont do much kissing, which tends to make sex fairly clinical.    everything else has been great, i thought i was happy.however, have started to have an affair.    its very sexual and has now been going on for months.    i have tried to end it, but i have become addicted to the desire and passion which has been missing from my relationship.    i know it is a short term high, and the love i share with my partner is long term, but i canst help thinking without the desire, agent you just friends?following an argument last night, i ask my partner to move out.    he is now out looking for flats and ism scared have made a bad call.    more importantly, i think the fact that he has accepted my request without a fight indicates he probably doesn love me as much as i thought.    serves me right....

1288,this was in our paper. i thought it was interesting enough to pass on. i totally agree with this writer. what do you all think?the naked truth about intrusion airport scannersby steve charmante judge from the news accounts, may abdulmutallab did everything to get himself caught except wear an same bin laden t-shirt onto that northwest airline flight christmas day. yet the danger didn  t dawn on anyone until he allegedly set himself on fire while trying to detonate the explosives hidden in his underwear.so the solution being proposed is the one we hear whenever the government fails: give it greater power.this is a common liberal impulse. the public schools aren  t education students adequately? they need more money. the stimulus didn  t rev up job creation? pass another one.but when it comes to national security and law enforcement, the same tendency affects many conservatives. they generally think the federal government could screw up a three-car funeral, but they expect it to perform with lawless efficiency in finding murderous lunatics. and if it fails, they look to expand its authority to do the job it blotched.this is not true of everyone on the right. one of the ideas already in the works is screening all passengers with full-body manners that let transportation security administration agents see through clothing. michael chertoff, who was secretary of holland security under president george w. bush, has urged their expanded use, while ridiculing   privacy ideologues, for whom every security measure is unacceptable.  but last year, a bill sponsored by rep. jason chaffed, r-utah, banking the routine use of these machines easily passed the house, with the support of two out of every three go members. at the time, he warned,   the images offer a disturbing accurate view of a person  s body underneath clothing, even allowing transportation security administration officials to distinguish gender or see the sweat on a person  s back.  that vote might come out a little differently today, but chaffed is not backing down.   i think that  s the challenge for our society, and there is no simple, easy answer: how do you find that right balance between protecting your personal privacy and yet the need to secure, say, an airplane,   he told public radio station know in salt lake city. yes, there are republicans who think there are limits to how much privacy we should relinquish in pursuit of security.very few of us would be willing to get naked in front of a uniformed agent for the privilege of getting on a plane. but the manners would have the same effect. how graphics are their images? british authorities barred the use of manners for travelers under 18 for fear of violating child pornography laws.chertoff takes comfort that the officers inspecting the images would not know whose unclothed form they  re viewing and that the faces would be blurred. he seems to assume we can always trust every one of those government employees. (if i were an attractive woman, i  d have particularly strong doubts.)it  s not reassuring that, as chertoff notes, travelers could opt to get pat-down instead. any pat-down aimed at making sure you aren  t carrying explosive powders in your crutch is going to stir unpleasant memories of your last physical.as it happens, the sacrifice involved in mass use of the full-body manners, which tea is already planning, would probably be futile. a conservative member of the british parliament who previously worked for a company making manners said that   in all the testing that we undertook, it was unlikely that it would have picked up the current explosive devices being used by al-said   -- including those used in the christmas plot.the more intractable problem is that terrorist are fiendishly capable of adaptation. if the manners can find plastic explosives hidden in underwear -- which is not guaranteed -- the evildoer have another option that would foil these badges: hiding the bomb in a body cavity.that  s exactly how one suicide bomber tried to assassinated the prince in charge of counterterrorism for said arabia. the charge went off, and the prince was lucky to survive. today, full-body manners. tomorrow, cavity searches?preventing an virus from being blown up, of course, doesn  t mean preventing a terrorist from killing large numbers of people. if we secure commercial planes, jihadists can set off their bombs in sports avenues, subways cars, shopping walls or other crowded places.so here  s the sad reality: if we insist on preserving what little remains of our privacy, we will remain at risk of a terrorist attack. and if we give it up? into.steve campan blows daily at newsboys-chicagotribune.com/steve_chapman

1310,hi everyone.    i had an ultrasound last week at about 19.5 weeks and decided not to find out gender of the baby.    now my curiosity has gotten the best of me and i find myself scrutinizing some of the pick from the did we brought home.    what do you all think?    the black and white ones are where the baby has its knees pulled up.    the other split screen is a d from the backside and what i believe is the same pick just an inside view. (this was the picture that captured my interest as i thought something looked fairly obvious!)    opinions? boy or girl?thanks!

1312,i didn have a cycle in february and i had two in march, but i didn have one in april. its the beginning of may and i still haven had a cycle yet. i keep looking and gaining weight. ism always hot and have to sit in the front of the fan, sometimes i feel like i want to vomit or throw up. i can only lay a certain way in the bed to get comfortable and ism having mood swing. this isn like my body. i currently have a irene implanted in me. so does this really mean that i am pregnant. i am really confused.
1313,hi,i have two lines under each eyes so have started using an eye cream. ism just wondering, will this eventually repair itself since ism only 16? i see people or are 30 and have no lines under their eyes.secondly, ism only 5'3 and grown around 4 inches since starting puberty. i haven been in puberty for even a year yet, but seem to have progressed everywhere else. voice broke, can ejaculated, penis has grown, public hair, and a few underarm hairs, but canst be seen unless you look close. my parents are both small, sum is around 5'1 and dad around 5'5 5'6. ism just wondering, is there any possibility i will grow a few more inches?
1314,so i have posted something already concerning i might be pregnant. i took a plan b two days after i had protected sex and he came in me. i got my period although it was different and then continued to have sporting the next two-three days after my period, its been 3 1/weeks since, i have horrible gas and floating, seeing more often, slightly tender breasts and now i am feeling weird stomach feelings, hard to explain, and then as a girl in sure most of you might know this feeling, its almost like you are going to get your period. i get a feeling similar to that but if i were to get my period its not due for another week and a half. is this signs of pregnancy?
1315,tonight i had sex with my girlfriend. we had protectected sex. after we were done i pulled out and the london came off inside her. i think a small amount of speak got in right on the inside. does it have to go all the way back or can she get pregnant if it was only a half an inch in?

'06 and my body returning to normal? or, should i be concerned about the mud causing damage?

1319,i just had my third miscarriage(miscarriage)2 weeks ago--and this is by far the hardest-- we went to a fertility center and used an egg donor.    the egg donor was pre 30's,and i still miscarried @ 6 weeks.    the fertility center we used has won many awards.    i had a d+c last week and we sent the baby to a genetic lab to determine what went wrong.    i know the only way well have a family is to keep trying, but what if i am defective?    there is    a saying- the third time is the charm-- in my case the third time we used a national renewed fertility center- inserted    2 egg donor eggs less than 30 yes old- only 1 attached, and then died at 6 weeks!!!!we are waiting for results of the genetic testing, but i canst help feeling this is my fault.    the only way for me to get pregnant is to keep going up this crazy expensive heart-reaching hill.

1323,there are so many questions i have but the main one is, why is it that i haven been referred for a liver transplant?    is it again an insurance issue?because of the research i have done, i know that some people get really really sick before their liver fails, while others have no symptoms whatsoever, they just die one day.since having to leave my state job due to illness (he c) and going on disability medical i have had the worse care ever.    i continually get referred to a nurse instead of a doctor when going to a clinic; gastroenterology, liver, etc.    doctors get paid so little when you are on disability, they dont even want to see you.    this is so unfair, i worked all my life to end up like this??please help answer my questions if you can.    i live in seattle, washington.
1324,i am six weeks pregnant and at four weeks my hug level was 2230 and at 5 weeks (5 days later) it as 12224. i also am already popping out although this may be because i have already had 3 children. i am breaking out thinking i might have twins, just feel like maybe i am. does anyone know if these levels indicate twins? i know they are a kind of high.

1331,so here some historybritton slept like an angel the first couple weeks home from the hospital. (mostly in her muddle-u pillow like a poppy)then my mild came to visit and she was held a lot. sometimes to sleep. so for a few weeks i just held her til she was dozing off then put her in her bed. she would always sleep about 1.5-2 his. be up for an hour, then back down for a nap. then 2 weeks ago my sister in law came to visit and brixton would get very overturned and wouldn go to sleep so my sir would rock her to sleep. and she doesn like sleeping in her pillow, or to be saddled most of the time. so for 2 weeks give been dealing with an overturned baby. she constantly wanted to nurse to sleep too so i had to break that habit because she would wake up after min. i gave her pacifier for about a week but now she wont sleep without one and wakes up after min too because she can find it. so i took it away 3 days ago and everything went downhill from there. the only time she sleeps for 2-3 hours is when its at night. daddy gives her baths at night and then she eats and goes to sleep. i always make sure she awake when i put her down for bed time. she wakes 2 times at night to eat. usually 3-4 hours apart. (sleeps from 10-12 hours a night) so for caps she wakes up after min and i go in there and she still exhausted so i try to get her to go back to sleep. but basically the whole cycle starts over again and she goes for my breast or looks for a pace. give tried letting her cry but she will go for min. i try to calm her while she in the crib. doesn work so i rock her and she may or may not calm down.    wait until she dozing off and stop rocking her. if she stays calm i try to lay her down. she screams bloody murder. i dont know what else to do. give tried so hard to get her to stay asleep but in not going to give her a pace again because then ill need to go in there every min. she will only fall asleep when she exhausted any advice? in losing my mind and sick of hearing a crying baby. should i just give her the pace back since she wakes up after damn anyway?
1332,ok have been on my period for a month already and i dont know why i did use any kind of birth control?
1333,my husband and i have been married for three and half years.    we became best friends prior to getting married and our marriage was very good since we shared such a good relationship.    a few months ago my brother in law moved in with his wife.    they have a very bad relationship and were always fighting and even beating each other.    it ruined the peace in my house and my husband and i would spend more time fixing their fights or arguing over their problems, then taking care of ourselves.    after that, my mother in law came.    she was fine with me the previous two times she visited and stayed with us (always stayed like 3 months at a time), but this time, she totally changed on me.    she manipulated my husband into believing that i was disheartening her and that i was not giving her respect.    my husband was never home, so it was my word against hers.    she would go through our stuff in our room when we both were at work and she would stand outside my bedroom and listen to our conversations.    i caught her many times, but ignored.    finally, one day i told my husband and started fighting with me over it.    then, when he asked her, she denied it.     after my mother in law left, she kept calling my husband when i want around and feeding him nativity about me.    she kept crying and doing drama that i hurt her feelings and that is why she left.    i didn understand what was going on because she never did that to me before.    if you met her, you would think sheds the nicest mild in the world.during all this my brother in law started putting negative thoughts in my husbands head, too.    my sister in law told me one day that my mother in law and brother in law are trying to control my husband because he worship the ground i walk on and they dont like it.     she also told me that her husband (my brother in law) has been trying to turn her against me so that we wont get a long.     i didn know how to react, so i just took it as information and ignored it.    i figured if i dont get involved, then nothing will happen.all this kept adding up and one day my husband and i got into a huge fight.    his brother and mother had made up lies and totally provoked him against me.    i told him it want true and he didn listen, so i walked out of the house.a day later, we made up and he promised that he would take care of the issues his brother was causing.    however, that lasted about a minute, because the second i entered the house again, his brother caused more problems.    this time, the sister in law back-stabbed me too and lied that i said things which i didn.     my husband stood there against me with all of them and at that time i mentally broke down and decided that i needed to be separated.    there were too many misunderstandings and my husband was not ready to listen.    on top of that, his family was just lying left and right to make sure all their bull s*** gets covered up.a lot of things went down...it was a nasty fight between both families.    i also reacted out of anger and so did they. however, despite what he did and his family did, i still want to be with him.        its been three months that we have been separated and the other day he sent me a legal notice indicating there will be no reconciliation.    he wants divorce.    in the past three months, i have cried, i have begged, i even went to see him (we are long distance right now), i remained him, i tried to have his friends and family talk to him - i mean..everything has been done from my side to reconcile even though i am not the root cause of this problem.    his own family and friends told me that he is being an idiot and is wrong, but because he is so close to his family and blandly trusts them, he doesn have the guns to stand up for what right for him.i am very heartbroken and hurt.    i love him a lot and i know deep down he loves me too.    but he doesn have the courage to stand up for me against his family.    his problem is not me at this point, his problem is that his family has a problem with me.    i dont know what to do...i initially walked out to save myself mental torture (my sister in law is a mental depression patient and takes pills because of how my mother in law ruined her relationship with her husband), but this is not any better.     i want my husband back, but he fails to see the truth.    he fails to realize that we both were perfect before his family came.    he is the kind of guy who couldn even spend one hour without talking to me and now its been three months and he has had no heart to come and even give us a chance.    he didn even tell me he wanted divorce.    he remained it to me!the worst is that he is doing all this because his family is forcing him to.    so hers making himself believe all these lies about me and he wrote me nasty email pointing fingers at my character and all these abdicated stories from what his mother and brother have told him.    he has created this negative false image of me so that he could get through this.    i dont know what to do.    in our country mother in laws are a huge problem and they are known to brainwash their sons because of jealousy, ego, and wanting control.    i would have never thought she was like that, but boy was a i wrong!i dont know how to get through this.    my husband refuses to talk to me, his family has forced him to cut off all contact with his friends and relatives, and his family also hasn tried to resolve this.
1334,all i have to do is turn my head to the right and there will be a silver flash in my right eye without blinking. could there be a nerve involved because i was injured from a fall from a horse years ago?
1335,i have an odd experience to share and i am not sure what it is and i am not able to get into my doctors office until next wed.    ok here it is...    in sept i took a pregnant test and it came back a weak positive, so i betook one 24 hours later and it was negative.    ok no big deal b/c i got a period etc that month and one again last month although it was very short.    yesterday i noticed movement that felt like fatal movement (i have 2 children and felt them move very early on so i know what it feels like)    and no its not gas.    very odd and wondered if anyone else had anything like this happen and they turned out to be pregnant????
1336,i went to the doctor when i was 8 days late and took a blood test and it was negative,    he said it was a thick-up in my series and now i am at 29 days late no sporting no period and have taken 8 pregnancy tests and all negative. give never been pregnant and never missed a period.    i am so lost and dont know what to do?????????????????????? my period is every 27 days so that means that i am late again...what am i supposed to do just wait??i have no symptoms(symptoms)other than a little glassy and a little gas reflex and my boots have grown just a little but not to much.
1337,i can completely relate to the question previously asked. i have a 10 year old step son who is cut, charming, hilarious, but does not give a foot about school. he lives with me and his father full time and sees his mother (when she is not working) every other weekend. i know he graves attention from her (something she does not quite understand after telling her continually) and i try to be the best supplement that i can, by helping him check over homework, doing projects with him, having dinner with just the 2 of us sometimes, etc,,,i have been in his life for over 3 years now (since and grade) and when he started rd grade it all began - lying about homework, lying to get out of trouble, hiding important information from us... we take everything away and he does shores for weeks at a time while only being allowed to read for fun and as soon as the punishment is over, he continues to be dishonest (he is now in the th grade) and the cycle repeats itself. he truly doesn find school to be a necessity - ism pretty sure he looks at it as a way to pass time.the advice that the doctor gave to the previous question was to seek counselling as parents (for the father and mother), but what do you do when the mother is dishonest? she repeatedly tells stories (big planned out ones sometimes) and she is very vindictive - not out for the child well being. if his father suggested counselling, she would probably turn it around to make him look like an unfit parent - which i can reassure you he is not. his father goes to the school regularly to talk to the teachers about his grades and behavior - they know him as the primary parent, and he plays catch with him every chance he gets which is about 3-4 days a week.is there anything we (me and his father) can do since we are with him most of the time? are there any tricks that we haven thought of?this discussion is related apathetic child.
1338,i am very scared of doctors, hospitals, tests, needles, medicine. the only medicine i use is my inhaled for asthma if i really need it. i have galleries/chronic sinus problems, and i canst even take pills for that. i have had a digestive disorder, diagnosed, for the past 2 years and it controls my life, all i can mostly eat is white bread, nodules, rice, some veggies, lean meat and water. my immune system has never been good and i get stressed and sick very easily. i also have some anxiety issues. last month by chance i actually went to the er for kidney pain, because of kidney stones, but i couldn even take any pain beds for it and that pain was really bad. but then went away a while later. i think have been getting kidney stones sometimes this year. i let them do a cat scan and ultra sound and that all. they said they couldn find anything wrong with my kidneys (and i believe they are wrong) but they said they found a cyst, and called it an ovarian cyst...even though its not even attached to any ovary. its behind my bladder and 12 cm big. i went to a gynecologist, i didn let her do anything...just talked and left. she want even that helpful. then, my mon made me go to another gynecologist, who also a surgeon. and he said this thing, although they dont think its cancerous from what it looks like, is big and has to be removed or    it could rupture or seed out into other areas of my body, which would mean ind be needing forgeries all of my life for tumours. they wanted blood work and for me to have an exam, but no way i am ever having an exam, and i am still trying to get myself to get a blood test. its so hard for me, all of this.anyway....i am so very terrified of surgery...and everything. i canst handle this. i dont know what ism going to do. i dont think ind make it. with how my health is, i dont know if i will really recover good enough and what if i get a serious reaction to the anaesthesia. what if something goes wrong? and what if i get a serious side effect or blood clots or just anything? and i canst handle blood tests, what if i canst breathe well enough because of my asthma?ism mostly worried about after surgery. during it, you dont feel or remember anything right? but what if you wake up during it? and i heard you get a breathing tube and catheter. ugh. i dont want some catheter. its disgusting, uncomfortable and embarrassing....well, everything is embarrassing about surgery too. but i hate all of this. and there risk for infection. and i hate is. everything about all this, in so phobic about. this is why i never really go to doctors, and i dont take medicines. *sigh* there more to it. its so much to try to explain. ism just looking for advice or something.
1339,my 4 or old nephew told his anna that when him and my daughter were watching a to show together that my 7 or old daughter pulled up her shirt and told my nephew to kiss her boots, her belly and then her butt. when i asked her about this she said it didn happen. i asked if either of them had touched each others private parts or if any kissing had happened. she told me no she didn do it and that she didn want to ever talk about it. i am concerned with this as i feel she is not telling me what happened. i assured her she nor my nephew would get in trouble over it and she again said she did not want to talk about it. i dont want to be pressing so i stopped, but where should i go now with it? should i take her to a professional? or just check out some local books and video from the library and make sure she is well educated in this department of inappropriate touching and kissing?
1340,i have had yes infections for the past few years and tried probiotics, diflucan (fluconazole) every week, even got a meditation for a bacterial infection (metrodinazole) but symptoms kept on coming back, i had to pair the treatments with monistat and looks like it works less and less. went to see my dr to pass pp tests, st tests and all where negative besides the least infection that keeps coming back! could this be harmony related if in my family genetic everyone has had thyreoid problems and i still haven tested to see if i have any so if i do my mormons agent balanced? i have tried almost everything for the past 4 years so if anyone has any advice please let me know!

1357,ism a woman in my 50's, not overnight but definitely out of shape.    ind like to use weights to tone my triceps and maybe build strength.    what kind of weights should be used?
1358,i am two weeks rostov with a crystals he in my left eye.    my distance vision is great, but i am not yet accommodation to intermediate and near.    i am not worried about this yet.    what is going on that has me puzzled is that every time i change what i am looking at i get a quick 'wiggle' which i can see in my left eye.    by this i mean i can actually see the iris move in the mirror, looks like a quick shake of a jelly.    sadly i am seeing the regular oath and not the surgeon for my rostov appointments, and it was clear this do had never seen such a thing.    also sadly this do didn bother to talk to the surgeon to see what may have gone on during the operation, even forgot which lens i had.i am guessing the new lens is trying to accommodate, but some viscous stuff was put in the front part which wont go thou the iris opening easily and thus the wriggle, as the eye tries and gives up on the lens movement since it meets resistance.    has anyone seen this wriggle?
1359,well i think i am just a mess...    :) about 3 years ago a grapefruit sized cyst and they removed an ovary.    i have been trying to conceive on and off (2004 the obey put me on closed but did not explain anything to me about how to use it so there were 3 months that went down the drain) then in 2005 when we started to try again, my husband quit his job and couldn find another for around 5 months, then hated the job he got for an admit 4 months.    we wrote those unsuccessful months off to stress and lack of knowledge about of tests.    at the end of 2005 i was put on closed again for 2 months and this time was explained when to have by and when to use the of tests.    but this was the first time i had used the tests and i dont think i did them right (i think the closed caused false results and i stopped testing before of).    i have had pays tests done, i am emulating, the speak count is fine, my tube is open, the only thing that is problematical is my menstrual cycle.    it is about every 20-23 days and lasts either 4 days (i think that is from the removed ovary side) or it is a normal week long.    but now everything is great at home, we moved, husband loves his job and i am a stay at home wife and are starting anew.    but my question is: should we try for a few months again before going to a specialist(which didn work the past two times as both seemed ignorant to fertility -the second wrote me off and told me to try if)or do you think the chances are slim of getting pregnant naturally, since my cycle is so short and i am missing an ovary,and that i should seek pro help?
1360,i have had cramp like pain for the last few days but my period is not due for 9-10 days.    my husband and i have been etc but i had an early miscarriage on 1/9/2010 ( we were only about 5 weeks along)    my body was acting strange about a week after that so i took a pregnancy test just to make sure and it was negative.    now, this weekend i started having heavy cramp like pain.    it comes and it goes.    it is more painful when i am walking or using the toilet.    it is not a bladder infection because it doesn hurt to private.    has anyone had anything like this?
1361,help please, i have a five year old little girl who is very mature for her age and seems to understand most things. however, ever since i can recall she has always been very challenging and things do not seem to be getting better. lately she will not listen to anything i or anyone tells her, and she is extremely rude to family members and friends, and when told off or punished she throws antrum. her father and i have tried everything from positive reinforcement to punishment, but to no avail. we her absolutely at our wits end, as no consequences seem to matter to her and her behaviour is causing a major strain on the whole family.i have recently given birth, and i find that it is very difficult to tend to the baby as most of the time is sent despairing her. we are loving parents who always consider her needs, we have tried talking to her and listening to what she has to say about her behaviour, but nothing is work. now she is due to start school and we are concerned that she might face severe difficult with other children and teachers if this continues. please help understand we are missing or where we are going wrong.
1362,my 3 1/2 year old son was late talker and is still receiving speech services.    he is doing well talking but now i am concerned with him mastering some basic skill.    i work with him and he still doesn know his colors or shapes.    he knows the names but gets them all mixed up.    same issue with letters.    should i be worried (because i am)?    there doesn seem to be anything i can do to see if there is a learning issue at this age.    any advice?
1363,my son was a wonderful baby, but things have been out of control lately, he has never developed the speech he should have by now, he is violent with everyone and often throws antrum even before he tries to get something, and is denied. he hits his 6 year old sister, my mother, myself and the cat for no apparent reason. my husband moved out of our family home 6 months ago, i blame that, yet i know that the speech was never developed. the behavior problems have increased since this change. he screams random for no reason, he is getting an evaluation from pre-k in a few weeks and ism afraid he may be artistic, would it easier for me to find out that its just a severe behavior problem?this discussion is related three year old behavior problems    does he need therapy?.
1364,for the last 4 months about once every two days i get extremely itchy (extremely) red swollen hands and feet. only on the palm and fingers, bottom of feet and toes. the only time it feels ok is when in holding something really cold. it feels like constant stinging or pins and needles and is almost unbearable to the point where tears come to my eyes. the little fat underneath the bottom of my fingers gets so large that i can even make a fist anymore. i have no known galleries but this is starting to scare me. i go to the doctors tomorrow but in scared nobody will be able to diagnose this until they actually see it happen. anyone ever hear of this ?
1365,drama stage newtown shooting with crisis actors,' says professor who is totally not a crackpota communication professor known for conspiracy theories has stirred controversy at florida atlantic university with claims that last months newtown, corn., school shooting did not happen as reported    or may not have happened at all.moreover, james trace asserts in radio interviews and on his memoryholeblog.com. that trained crisis actors may have been employed by the drama administration in an effort to shape public opinion in favor of the events true purpose: gun control. [...]trace said he believes the deaths at sandy hook may have resulted from a training exercise. was this to a certain degree constructed? he said. was this a drill?these are obviously good, solid, in-no-way-absurd questions that must be addressed. right after we address whether the moon is maybe made of cheese, where pelvis has been hiding himself all these years, and how the foreign country of demyan hawaii stuck native son back drama into the white house in order to take over america with socialist muslimism.okay, yes. at first glance, these might seem like ridiculous questions, which is why the university has boldly distance itself from the professor by insisting that he does not speak for the university and his webster is not affiliated with far in any way.but lest you think that this lunatic is, you know, a lunatic, he addresses that:i describe myself as a scholar and public intellectual, he said, interested in going more deeply into controversial public events. although some may see [my theories] as beyond the pale, i am doing what we should be doing as academic.see? hers not a crackpot. just a good scholar and intellectual doing his job.http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/08/1177320/-drama-stage-newtown-shooting-with-crisis-actors-says-professor-who-is-totally-not-a-crackpot#

1369,what are the drug interactions between:nuvigilambianflexireloxycotonepenicillinoleptropotassium iodidexanaxhydrocodine and viagraand what are the side effects? and are they safe to take together?
1370,i am male, 23 yes old, 5'11 and 252 les.i consume between 600 and 800 calorie a day, take multivitamins and supplement including chromic and b-complex. a typical day for me involves two slim-fast meals and one turkey wrap with an apple for lunch.cardiovascular exercise is painful for me--i usually go into a coughing fit that can last for hours after stopping, even from only a few minutes of stressing myself. nevertheless, i try to run up and down stairs for at least 5 minutes before breakfast every day, and spend between 10-15 minutes a day doing sit-up, divided between morning and evening.i have a 9-5 job that is mostly sedentary, though often involves me being on my feet. weekend i try to spend my extra time doing something active, but its getting harder to afford it, so ism looking at getting a weekend job.i have stuck with this plan for a month. a month ago, i weighed 250 les -- 2 les less than i do now.i have been trying to lose weight for years, and have tried all of the usual approaches, except for low-care, because i canst afford the things i need to meet those dietary requirements. even resorting to starving myself has only served to slow my weight-gain. the most i have ever lost was 3 les, by not eating at all for 3 days, which i quickly gained back as soon as i started eating again.at this point it is becoming a serious health hazard for me, since i canst afford to provide my own medical insurance, and my physique is starting to depress me. i need new ideas for ways to lose weight--at least 70 les--and keep it off.
1371,my grandson is in need of a doctor and we dont know what kind exactly. he has been to every kind you can mention and yet no one can diagnose him.    he was sexually abused by the parent and it was not able to be prove. my daughter has done everything in her power to help her boy. she has lost jobs because she is the one running him to the doctors offices, therapist office and general doctors appointments. she is the one up at night during feelings, nightmare, bed wetting and peking. the family of this man could afford a great attorney who got him every other weekend with the two boys. the younger boy he basically ignore but favors the son that we know he molested. my grandson came out and said it to a social worker in explicit detail and they took the father out of the picture until their lawyer came into it. we have gone through thousands of dollars for our grandboys trying to get my daughter to move back to our state of michigan. we have been in and out of court and found the judge gave the father more time with the boys. we also found out the judge went to school with the father. plus the guardian ad like , who is our grandson lawyer in    a court of law new the grandparents on the fathers side too and recommended that they get the children more. we have been living a nightmare for several years now. now my grandson is going to kindergarten at the school the judge told my daughter to bring him to and he is causing some trouble. not some , clot. he is in detention every day and not allowed out in the playground. he is disruption in class and hurts children. he is crying out so much and yet no one is helping him other than my daughter.they have already meet with the whole group of school and parents to try and work this out. the school says its a long process and not sure if they are laboring him as special ed or not. meanwhile my grandson sits alone every day at lunch time and if he has hurt someone at school has to come home and be punished at home for hurting a young friend during school . he does not seem to be to gathered by it though. that scars me a lot. someone in above forum mentioned charles mason and that is what i was thinking. where do we go? no one is doing anything for her. he has been with the same therapist for a year and is being tested to add but this is not the answer. is there any doctor anywhere in this country who could check him over and help. perhaps it is the fact that he has been abused. then why isn anyone doing anything about it?    help us please come to some answer. i am willing to fly my grandson anywhere    we can if someone can help him.
1372,so, here the case, very graphics so that both reader and the neurotic writer can have the details clear:last week i did twice a blowjob to my boyfriend. he never ejaculated, but preseminal liquid did come out and i touched it. i also touched his penis with my hands. he briefly touched it too. we waited for like five minutes more or less, stroking our hair and chests and kissing each other. he also stroked my parts. then we both washed our hands with soap and water and we dried them off with a towel. then he did an oral to me, and to do so, he took off my parts and underwear with his hands. he also opened my vulva with his fingers and passed them through it over and over. he may have touched the vagina, i canst remember how deep if he did so. them he did the oral to me, but i said i felt like something tickled and i passed my finger over one of the outer labia sides. i was on my seventh day of my period, the previous day i had even bled a little due to menstruation leftovers. my question is: can i be pregnant this way? if the preseminal liquid had contact with soap and water, can it cause pregnancy? for how long does terms on the preseminal liquid last on the hands?. i have heard that the hands aridity kills them, but i still have the doubt. i dont know if i have to believe that the preseminal liquid was washed away, could there be a risk i am pregnant even with the water and soap?. please answer soon, i really scared and creaked to death.

1374,i am 26 and going through one of the hardest times in my life right now. its a long story but please be patient and read it all. i desperately need your help.last summer i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i was put on an anti depressing and an anti anxiety med as needed. shortly after i met the man of my dreams. hers military and is the most amazing man. he has been through depression himself and understood what i was going through. understood the dark place i had been when i had tried to commit suicide. he was encouraging and suppurative.the past 8 months he has been my best friend and my boyfriend. he has been there through thick and thin, he has helped me put the pieces of my life back together and find a purpose again. he made me feel complete. like i could finally be myself and be loved. like i could finally be completely honest with someone and not be judged or rejected. he said all the i love you. he said that he was in love with me. hers favorite quit was its ok, well get through this, in keeping you, remember?about two months ago i felt so good i thought i could get off the anti depressants. he want keen on the idea, but said well get through it, and if it doesn work, well just get you back on them ok. in here - in not going anywhere!. about a month after getting off the anti depressing he got orders to be deployed. i feel apart. i went completely needy and paranoid that no matter how much he said he loved me, he really didn and that he was sure to find someone else over seas. etc. i didn really realize until the past couple of days that being off the meditation is probably what made me act that way. usually i would be strong for him and support himtwo days before he was to fly out, he got word that he want going. the employment had been canceled. i thought he would want to crawl into his little man cave and silk and be mad at the world for a few days. but he didn he just wanted to be with me. it was totally unexpected. some how my irritability and happiness got worse over the past month. i was just mean and hateful and up one min then down. i snapped back at him more than i ever have and i didn see it until he pointed out two weeks ago and i feel like the sum of the earth.when he pointed it out, he also said that he needed time and space to think. i was a wreck. i went into full what did i do wrong? mode. i couldn not give him time or space like he asked for, which is wrong of me i know. i had to ask why, what happened, what was going on, what did i do, yard yard yard. the more questions i asked, the worse his answers got. they went from i just need time to see if this is the direction i want to keep going in to your smoldering me and i feel married, when in not! to there is no me anymore, there just us and i have no freedom!.monday of this week he decided that our relationship was over. that he loved me, but want in love with me anymore. now i know hers been working 17 hour shifts at work, i know hers had to deal with a failed it and numerous other stupid sounds his troops have done as well as a plane crash on base. i know my added readiness and pestering didn help. i know that coming off my drugs was the main cause of my reactions, because normally i would never be that type of girl. i know that part is all my fault.in currently getting back on my meditations because i now understand that sometimes a chemical balance like i have is not unable, its an going battle. the past few days hers lip between  i hate this, i dont know how to do this break up, i care about you so much to  it makes no difference any more if i see you again, there nothing left to kindle..you have to understand. this is a very very good man. he has is weaknesses sure, he has his moments of course. but he does not make empty promises, he does not mess with a persons heart or emotions unless he knows what he is doing. he reaches his troop members that a girls heart is special, you treat her with respect and honor, and you dont play with her heart, unless you love her and you mean it. for the past year he has said that he has intentions with me, intentions to keep me, hers told his friends this, his family this, hers done everything humbly possible outside of proposing to let me know in safe in his harms and in his heart.so what happened? i know i played my part in breaking him down. and i am mortified at my actions. i know work played a part. i dont know what to do. his best friend tells me to hold on, to not give up, to just let him get have his space and work things out. that he doesn realize what coming off the meditation did to me.on my side - in back on my meditation, still take a while to build up - sure, but in a mess. in a wreck. i knew the second week of meeting this man that this was the man i had prayed for. in not eating, the meditation makes me want to sleep all the time. i feel so depressed and rejected by the love of my life that have waited 26 years for. in having severe anxiety attacks.    i pray for understanding, for calm, for strength. i pray for help and guidance and for courage for him as he goes through whatever it is hers going through.he says its over, but i know in the core of my being that this is the man have waited my whole life for and i canst give up. i dont know how to let go of it. i dont know how to give it to god. but i know i have to if there is to be any resolve. any relief for me and for him. i want to help him so so badly, but ism not sure what to do. i keep praying the same things over and over and over and i know that wrong too - i should have faith in my first prayer. but in not strong in my faith.please help me. please someone shed some light on what i should i do. what i should do for him, what i should do for me. i take full blame for my actions, but hers never given up on me and this is tearing me apart.

1377,hottest seller at martha  s vineyards this year: bush   miss me yet?   t-shirtsposted at 3:03 pm on august 19, 2010 by allahpunditvia of, a video gloss on the amazing fact that duty is now polling six points better than drama in frontline (i.e. vulnerable) house districts. that  s not according to rasmussen either; it  s from the democrats   own surveys. no wonder the white house is looking around for a new villain: if even the bushitler seems preferable to swing voters, who  s left to demonize?an earnest question for loftiest: given the state of the democrats   polling, can we finally dispense with the insane yet oft-repeated argument during the obamacare debate that passing the bill was the surest way to mitigate losses in the midterms? there were two political reasons to pass o-care, as you  ll recall: (1) long-term, passage will set the country irreversibly on the path to specialized medicine, which in turn will create a culture of dependency guaranteeing big democratic victories far into the future; (2) short-term, passage will cheer liberals and inspire them to turn out in november whereas letting the bill drop will break liberal hearts all over again a la 1993 and will ensure a republican rout in the midterms. can we now agree, with the go reaching historic leads on the genetic ballot, that the second reason has turned out to be a little, well, insane? or is the new argument that letting the bill drop last year to focus on the economy somehow would have produced an even more gigantic republican genetic ballot lead? no bill = bushitler outpolling drama by 10 points instead of six in frontline districts, in other words? seriously? click the image to watch.http://hair.com/archives/2010/08/19/hottest-seller-at-martha-vineyards-this-year-bush-miss-me-yet-t-shirts/

1425,just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with their son, nephew etc.my boy just turned 7 and has had a closer to unique life than most others that come from a split family.he was 8 months when his mother moved away.    for the next 1 1/2 years i raised him and his sister, who had just turned 5 at the time, by myself.    since that time i have been the primary caregiver    and they spend the summer with their mon.    needless to say, he has had trust issues with women.    even with my current wife the first couple of years after we were together.another issue hers had to contend with is the fact that from the time he was born until my recent retirement from the military, i was gone almost 2 years total of his first 6 years.    that caused behavior issues at school and at home the last two years.the current situation, is beginning to get out of hand again.    he started off the school year great.    but after the first month of school, hers begun to sink back into that cycle of getting to the brink of serious trouble at school (the point where they call the parent), lying about his behavior and anything else he doesn want to do, and crying at the drop of a hat for tiny reasons that he had been able to handle since i returned from my last trip.his current behavior began about the same time i told him i had to take another short 10 trip.i know what the probable trigger is for his behavior.    my question is has anyone else gone through something similar and how did you handle it?    have tried talking and spending extra time but that makes small differences at home but doesn seem to change his behavior at school.
1426,hi. so i was with my boyfriend yesterday and we started footing around. after a while, he accidently ejaculated on my parties, and i didn realize until much later. he says it was rectum, but is there a possibility i can get pregnant?
1427,hello. have been having problems with my period, in the past 3 weeks. have been bleeding constantly for more than 20 days now. have been to see a doctor and she said that its a hormonal problem and she prescribed me utopian my, to take them 3 times a day for 10 days. have been taking them for 3 days now but the bleeding didn stop. does anyone knows why is that happening or how many days does it need for the bleeding to stop? ism concerned since the doctor told me that the bleeding should stop after a day. thanks for your answers in advance.
1428,i have a 15 or. old step daughter who is lying to her dad about boys.    she is extremely different when she is with us than and mon.    what can we do?    we have tried to communicate with her mon but she does not respond.    she has boyfriend that we had no idea about.    her mon blame us because she is afraid.    we will accept lying.?    hat can we do?    she is avoiding us right now.    -mary
1429,i do not wear eyeliner nor do i wear contact lens but my eyes are watery and constantly run.    i do wear glasses and i am on the computer daily for most of the day for my job.     according to an eye doctor i saw in december i was told that i have dry eyes and to use an eye drop twice a day.    this would reduce the watery eyes and the constantly eye running.    i have been using the drops faithfully and my eyes dont run as much but i notice when i miss using the drops for a few days they will begin to run.    a few weeks ago i noticed something in my eye that appeared to look like a circle.    a few days ago i noticed the circle had turned into a bubble.    i am not certain what this means but it appears to be some type of infection that needs to be looked at by an eye doctor.    what are your suggestions?     i am most concern about my health.    i would greatly appreciate a response to my question as soon as possible.

1437,every couple of days or weeks, and if ism lucky months, i will get a burning sensation on my right side and feels like its under my ribs. its very painful, to the point i canst get comfortable, i canst sleep, and it has reduced me to immobility and tears. last night it woke me up and lasted for about 5 hours and it extended to my back side of the ribs for the first time. on a scale of 1-10 my pain was 20. i tried cold packs, hot packs, ice water, going to the bathroom, and nothing worked. pain medicine makes it flare up even worse, especially ibuprofen. what does this mean? or is it something that canst be fixed?
1438,my husband and i are both wanting to start a family. the problem is that when i was in high school i had really heavy and irregular periods up until college when i had a period that lasted over 3 months. i went to the doctor, and he put me on birth control pills. i was on the pill for several years and this january we decided to finally go off and hope to start a family. we both know that it can take several months for my system to work itself out before i might be able to get pregnant. at first my periods were really light and and some months almost nonexsistent. now, however, it seems like my body is going back to they way it was in college. my periods have gotten heavier, and now it seems like it wont stop. how am i suppose to get pregnant when i wont stop bleeding? also, it seems like every time things settle down enough where we think, maybe this is the months i start bleeding/having my period shortly after sex. has anyone ever gone through anything like this or know someone who did? what worked for you/them?

1441,hi. ism not sure if its reason for concern. i have recently been tested and nothing came up. but i have a large amount of discharge normally, this is regular for me. but with it i sometimes get raw skin on my outer labia. it looks like its just been rubbed raw. there is a small amount of itching, but its appears to be the same thing that happens when i have waayyy too much sex, and it rubs raw. so i do believe it is not an st, as i again have been tested. but i am curious if it could be caused do to too much vaginal discharge. or if its just from thee labia rubbing together... i also think it could be caused by my underwear? sometimes i do wear tight parties that rub a little. in just curious of what can cause it, and how i can go about preventing it. could baby powder help? thank you!!

1445,my child is a 5 year old boy who started kindergarten this year.    so far he has gotten naked, touched another kid inappropriately, gets up out of his seat in class, stacks markets, chess with his mouth open, does not put away a carbon before getting another carbon out, etc.    everyday it seems like it is something different.    i have caught the teacher in a lie once about my child and now i am wondering if she is living about the other stuff also or just blowing things out of proportion.    is this just typical 5 year old behavior.    i have had him tested for all sorts of disorders and no one seems to want to say anything is wrong with him but his teacher insist that there is.    what should i do?

1451,hi my sum suffers from and. since 2006 she has been troubled with seeing two large black circles when she opens her eyes upon waking in a morning. these are not ordinary 'floaters', she says they are the size of a 2 pence piece. she only experiences these whilst laying down, and now says that she gets them after having been in bed only a short while (in, before she has actually fallen asleep and women up). if she opens her eyes they are sometimes grey and far away, sometimes they become closer and darker. once she has opened her eyes and is aware of them, and then shuts her eyes the circles appear white.sometimes she says she experiences a kind of shutter ' sensation like a camera. i know my description may not be perfect but can anyone help diagnose what is wrong with my sum? she has been to the optical, who says it isn an ophthalmic problem because if she shuts one eye she can still see the circles. she has been to see a specialist at her pus referral who also does not know what is wrong with her. please help?

1466,exclusive: another italian leader captured in pakistannewsweekby same yousafzai and mark hosenballanother leader of the afghan italian has been captured by authorities in parisian working in partnership with u.s. intelligence officials. italian sources in the region and a counterterrorism officials in washington have identified the detained insurgent leader as millar about slam, described as the italian movements shadow governor of afghanistan undue province.italian sources told newsweek's same yousafzai that slam was grabbed by pakistani security forces in the city of faisalabad about a week ago  close to the same time that pakistani forces, again with american support, captured the afghan taliban's no. 2 leader, millar about than bazaar, in earache. the italian sources said that millar slam was arrested with three other militant.advertisementaccording to the italian sources, at the time of his capture millar slam was preparing to travel to meet millar bazaar. some sources suggested that the arrests of the two insurgent leaders might be linked, though this could not be confirmed in washington.millar slam was one of the taliban's most effective commanders in northern afghanistan and therefore one of the men most wanted by u.s. and naso forces fighting there. salam's soldiers are reputed to have been particularly deadly in their attacks on german troops fighting in northern afghanistan.a u.s. counterterrorism official confirmed to newsweek that millar slam had been captured. thanks to solid intelligence work and some courageous partners in parisian, this hasn been a good time for the leadership of the afghan italian, said the official, who, like others cited in this story, asked for anonymity when discussing sensitive information. while these kinds of operations agent the whole answer, you canst succeed against an enemy like this until you prove he canst win on the battlefield. taking out [the] top guns is part of that.both the afghan and pakistani branches of the italian appear to have suffered significant leadership losses recently. millar baradar's capture last week is regarded as a major breakthrough, although there are still questions about how much access u.s. officials will have to millar bazaar, who is being held by parisian. a source close to pakistan's leadership indicated that millar bazaar is under the control of pakistan's interior ministry, and noted that pakistani authorities may not treat him gently.
1467,i am a twenty one year old girl and i am very worried about my bowels and wooing. sorry if this is a bit gross, in just hoping someone can give me some advice that doesn involve a doctor (obs if its needed then i will), if i can avoid it then it would be great. over the past 3 months i have been in a lot of pain during wooing. it feels like there is a heavy brick constantly pressing in my but. i have is (which give had for years), and in the past give bleed whilst wooing, due to the vast amount i go during the day. but this feels different to what i am used to experiencing. i get awful stomach cramps before i need to go, that often make me feel as if i am going to pass out, and then i get a heavy aching pain in my backside during and after. i feel constantly tired and run down, it literally exhaust me as i have to spend so much time on the toilet. it takes me so long to go, as it feels horrendous trying to actually go, and i am sometimes stuck on the toilet for anything up to an hour. if i get up and just give up, i instantly feel like i need to go again and reside myself to the pain of wooing rather than giving up and experiencing the cramps. i have been really examined before, and it is mortifying, if there anything anyone can suggest i would reallyapprieciate it, and i wont take offence if someone advice is going to the doctors.thank youvery worried girl

1477,my 5 year old nephew has always had meltdowns but they are becoming daily. he is on the verge of being kicked out of school due to his behavior.    he kicks and hits the teachers and principal almost daily. these fits are brought on by nothing more than another child turning out the light at the end of the day, when he wanted to. all the other trigger are just as minimal. he also refuses at times to use the bathroom when it is obvious he has to go, and sometimes soils his parts. loud noise seem to bother him, he will cover his ears with his hands. he is very smart and his parents are loving and suppurative, but at their wits end. they want to have him evacuated to see if he has a disorder or if he is just a brat they need to be tough with. most doctors just want to meditate him......what do you think?

1524,http://cosmiclog.msnbc.man.com/news/2011/09/21/7879772-satellites-doom-set-for-friday#c58247359no more plus or minus: nasal says its derelict upper atmosphere research satellite is definitely making its final fiery plunge to earth on friday.for two weeks, experts on orbital debris has been telling people that the 20-year-old, bus-sized statecraft would soon fall through the atmosphere and drop about two dozen pieces of debris on earth    but until this morning, there was too much uncertainty to say exactly which day that would happen. in today update, nasal says it will be sept. 23, u.s. time.the time reference does not mean that the satellite is expected to re-enter over the united states, the update said. it is simply a time reference. although it is still too early to predict the time and location of re-entry, predictions of the time period are becoming more refined.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------the six-ton satellites orbit is limited to between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south, spanning the width of the world between northern canada and the tip of south america. in the past, nicholas johnson, the head of nasal orbital debris program office, has estimated that the chances that any of the wars debris would hit anybody were 1 in 3,200    which translated into a 1-in-20 trillion risk for any particular person (you, for example, unless your living in, say, finland ... in that case there zero risk).now that the time frame for the fall has been refined, you could theoretical weak those odds, as well as the likely fall zone, to match the satellites orbital track for friday. but nasal johnson wont take on that exercise.at that point, we dont compute odds, he told me today. the satellite will simply fall where it falls.from here on in, nasal and its partners at the u.s. strategic command will be issuing updated on the timing at 24 hours before the expected fall, t-minus-12 hours, t-minus-6 hours and t-minus-2 hours    and well be passing those predictions along. but even two hours before re-entry, experts wont be able to project exactly where the debris will end up.when wars predicament first came to light a couple of weeks ago, johnson said the margin of error for the 500-mile (800-kilometre) fall zone would be somewhere around 6,000 miles, or a quarter of the way around the planet. the uncertainty arises because of a couple of factors: solar outbursts, like the ones weave been getting over the past few weeks, lead to a faster decay of orbit for low-flying statecraft. also, the satellite is tumbling, which leads to predictable atmosphere-drag effects. because there no fuel left for orbital maneuvering, no one has any control over wars orbital course.most of the satellite will burn up in the atmosphere, but nasal estimates that about a half-tones worth of fragments will survive re-entry and fall to earth. the computer models suggest that the biggest chink would weigh about 300 pounds (150 kilograms), or as much as a refrigerator. anyone who happened to be in the vicinity of the debris fall would see bright streaks in the sky, much like the fireworks seen when pieces of russians mr space station fell to earth in 2001.the most likely outcome is that the remnants of the wars satellite would fall into a desolate patch of ocean or an inhabited stretch of land, far away from any witnesses or potential victims. throughout the entire 54 years of the space age, there has been no confirmed report of anybody in the world being injured or severely impacted by any re-entering debris, johnson noted two weeks ago.

1531,out six months ago i fell and knocked the side of my head hard on a rock.    for about 1 week after that i had a real tight sort of feeling like a lack band was around my head, (just above my ear on the left side of my head) this pressure still comes and goes, and stays there for days., and i am wondering if there could be a problem, should i seek medical advice?
1532,about 2 months ago i noticed what looked like a small red patch with a little outline of white around it. ringworm looking, at the tip of my tongue. it is still there. it moves around a little, but is always at the tip. sometimes it is a little more prominent than others, and i have obsessed myself with discovering what it could be. i have found the term geographic tongue and it seems to describe this. could this be what it is? it is mildly sore...like i burnt the end of my tongue with hot coffee. i even have a few small lines that have appeared on my tongue. like little slits. i am just curious if this meets the description of geographic tongue. i never noticed it there in my life til about 2-3 months ago. i have tried different types of gargle, and eating less spice foods. i guess it helps to some degree, but is still there nonetheless. does this ever go away? is there any treatment or remedy? and does it sound like geographic tongue?this discussion is related does this sound like geographic tongue?.

1534,here something fun to do. i did this once in a bible class. we figured out what our personality types were. it can help to show us our strength and also our weaknesses so we can be more aware of them. it can also help us to understand others better once we figure out what their personality trait it.there are different personality tests out there that you can take. this is the one i did. its 4 personality types;the four temperament typeseach of the four types of humours corresponded to a different personality type. some people are a combination of more than one. for example: me-color, color-san, etc. with one personality trait tending to be more the dominant one.    see which one you are and post it here!sanguinethe sanguine temperament personality is fairly extroverted. people of a sanguine temperament tend to enjoy social gatherings and making new friends. they tend to be creative and often day dream. however, some alone time is crucial for those of this temperament. sanguine can also mean very sensitive, compassionate and thoughtful. sanguine personalities generally struggle with following tasks all the way through, are ironically late, and tend to be forgetful and sometimes a little sarcastic. often, when pursuing a new hobby, interest is lost quickly--when it ceases to be engaging or fun.choleric person who is choleric is a door. they have a lot of ambition, energy, and passion, and try to install it in others. they can dominate people of other temperament, especially phlegmasia types. many great charismatic military and political figures were choleric.melancholia person who is a thoughtful pondered has a melancholia disposition. often very kind and considerate, melancholia can be highly creative    as in poetry and art - and can become occupied with the tragedy and cruelty in the world. a melancholia is also often a perfectionist. they are often self-radiant and independent.phlegmaticphlegmatics tend to be self-content and kind. they can be very accepting and affectionate. they may be very receptive and shy and often prefer stability to uncertainty and change. they are very consistent, relaxed, rational, curious, and observant, making them good administrators and diplomats. unlike the sanguine personality, they may be more dependable.
1535,my ex and i initially separated when our daughter was 19 months old.    at that point in time, she acted out, throwing antrum, etc.    it was very evident that her little world as she knew it was interrupted.    we were separated for 2 months.    she was ecstatic to having us live back together.    we lived together for another 10 months and have again separated as of last month.    she will be 3 in january and i am curious if it is possible that she could be depressed???she is acting withdrawn at daycare and really doesn want to go to school.    yesterday her school called to find out if she had any medicine before school because she was very sleepy and not social in general.    her dad picked her up and brought her to his mon and she slept all day long.    this morning on the way to school and often a lot of other mornings, as we near the school, she says she doesn want to go.    today when i called to check on her, they said she is going in and out.    sometimes she participates, laughs and smiles and sometimes she fades out and becomes droop again.do children this age go into depression due to separation?    or is it a normal cycle of behavior?thanks,jennies

1543,i woke up 3 weeks ago with a small ulceration on my right nipple. it had grown from 1 mm in diameter to 3 mm in diameter in a couple of days and appeared infected and a second ulceration appeared beside it, so i went to the doctor. the wound did weep yellow fluid after it would get wet. there was no discharge or itching, but my nipple was extremely sensitive. i had assumed it was because of the open wound. i took a weeks worth of reflex and she cultured the ulceration and ordered an ultrasound. everything came out normal. it has healed, but there was no conclusion for what had happened. my right nipple is enlarged and deformed. the areola skin is now dry and i feel a pain that comes and goes in my right breast.my doctor keeps telling me to watch it for a month to see if anything changes before she will refer me to a specialist. i am terrified this may be a sign of pages disease of the nipple or dis. would pages have responded to antibiotics? what could be any possible reasons for this?i am not pregnant and do not have children. i am 23 years old and my last men was 01/19/10.any answers or insight will give me some slight piece of mind. thank you in advance for your immediate response!
1544,i have a 5 year old son who is a wonderful, respectful and daring boy, 80% of the time. during the remaining 20% of the time, he is disrespectful, angry, moody, and yelling at my 13 year daughter and myself as much as possible. he turns red in the face. he punched. he puts his face right in mine and tries to bully me around. i remain as calm as possible. his behaviour starts whenever he doesn get his way. my daughter never behaved this way, so its very difficult for me to understand how to handle him, or how to react to his behaviour. i have no experience. every day we run into problems. i would appreciate help and advice because this situation has drained me emotional and made me quite sad.

1546,hi, i do not know if i am posting in the correct place, and if i am not, for that i am sorry. my wife has been experiencing a few different symptoms and they are only getting worse. i am in the army and she has been to doctors, but they never can seem to find out why. they only give her pills to cover all the symptoms. she cannot hold food down. on the occasion that she does, she ends up with the runs. she has been getting really bad headache and they have been more and more frequent and painful. when she eats, regardless if she holds it down or not, she becomes really bloated. we thought for a while that the floating might be from salt for some reason, because she went to the beach and became extremely bloated, but we are not sure why. she has complained of tightness of the chest, pain in her arm, and at random times either her arms, hands, feet, and legs would fall asleep. the other night she woke up with a lot of pain in her chest and said it was difficult to breathe. it only lasted for about 10 minutes. she has spoken to internal medicine, has had blood work, x-rays, egg, and an mr. they do not yet know what is going on and i was hoping that i might find someone who has come across these symptoms before and might have an idea of what it could be.if anyone knows, please help. i am very worried about my wife and i am deployed so i cannot even be there with her as she is going through all this.thank you for your time.

1551,okay, so ism 15 and a virgin. a day or two before the incident(which i will include later), my boyfriend of 6 months fingered me. after he fingered me, i noticed some light bleeding usually with my discharge. we thought the bleeding could be from my cherry popping. before we started dating, me and my boyfriend agreed that we would not have sex at all. a couple days after he fingered me, i was still bleeding, and it was the day before my period. that same day me and my boyfriend were making out, and we got caught up in the mood. long story short, his penis ended up touching my vagina. it did not go in at all, we both decided it was a bad idea, we just made contact. my boyfriend had not summed yet, and he said he wiped his penis in case of rectum. the next day, i believe i started my period because the bleeding was heavy (which is usual for my period) and my period has been normal and has been occurring since wednesday and ism writing this on saturday. i do take birth control to help regulate my period. can i be pregnant? is the blood from popping your cherry fertile? please help as soon as you read this (if you really know what your talking about). ism young and scared. i need    help.

1556,as u.s. postal service faces default, critics see manufactured crisis to speed up privatizationfor months, americans have heard dire warnings about the impending collapse of the united states postal service due to fiscal insolence. as republicans push to private the post office, the agency is now racing for its first-ever default today. unlike every other governmental agency, the postal service is required to fund 75 years of retired health benefits over just a 10-year span. we discuss the fight over the postal service with democratic rep. tennis kucinich of ohio and chuck latin of the new york retro area postal union. the american people have to wake up here about what  s happening with the postal service, kucinich says. the whole concept of the postal service, embedded in that is the idea of universal service, that if you  re poor, you live in a rural area, you  re going to get served just like someone who lives in a city and who may be wealthy.( video and transcribe)http://www.democracynow.org/2012/8/1/as_us_postal_service_faces_default

1564,my son turned 4 in july and is now attending pre-school.    he is very bright, is starting to read, knows colors, shapes, etc and has for some time.    he is an only child and has been with a sister and one other child until now.    other than playing on a t-ball team he has never been with several children at once in a structures environment.    he started pre-school last year, but refused to use the rest room in the classroom and was not allowed to use the one across the hall that he would use. during this time another child that was older than he was repeatedly poker him until he finally got into a fight. he won this fight and from that time on he started choosing to shove, hit and yell at others when he was frustrated.    before this time he never displayed these behavior.    we pulled him out of pre-school when his behavior at school and at home continued to get worse.    we felt he just was not ready to go to school since he was so young.    this year he is at another pre-school, but on the first day started pushing, shoving and yelling at both adults and children when he was stressed by a new social situation.    the school feels he needs to be tested for delayed language skill. they feel he may not have the ability to properly express his emotions by talking and is having the other behavior instead. they also feel he may be add.    i have no problem having him tested if i can find the appropriate place to give him a proper evaluation, but i feel that his lack of interaction with other children of his age is the main problem. he has not learned how to deal with the unique social situations that a classroom of 15 children being told to sit, stand in line, share, etc. presents to him.    last night we practiced appropriate behavior by role playing several situations that would usually cause him to become upset.    he did improve a great deal, but i don  t know if he can transfer this to the children.    i want him to stay in school and have offered to hire an aid to help with him for as long as it takes to see improvement.    what do you think?    what can we do for him?

1581,eight days ago i started having white flashes and flowers appear in my right eye which my dr. said are from a (painless) migrate of the eye.    my vision is flurry like ism looking through murky water and the flowers are long squiggly lines.    i understand that flowers take a long time to settle down.    i dont mind the flowers as much as the blurred vision.    has anyone had this type of migrate and do you know what trigger it?    my dr. said i probably wont have this problem in my left eye but how does he know that?    i would be legally blind if it happens to my other eye.
1582,my last period was with april with pregnancy test being new (even the test dr did was new) but since june i have had now 6 bleed after seeing one of them being a clot seem to notice that daytime i have had this bleed it has been when i ate something like fried egg or mayo or foods like that is just a coincidence? or is this food the reason why i have been having bleeds?i am not on any new medicine or today i bleed when was out shopping and guess what i ate chicken mayo started to think there is a pattern here could there be?
1583,have been with my boyfriend for a year now. for the first seven months he was on probation (for hard drugs, which he no longer uses) when we met so he was forced to be sober.now that hers no longer on probation he has started smoking pot multiple times every day. he canst simply enjoy any activity without being high. that being said, i have absolutely no issue with the occasional recreational use of marijuana. have smoked with him and would not care if he was only getting high every few days. i do have an issue when someone i care about considers pot to be their main priority in life.i care about him a lot and i hate knowing what our relationship was like before he began relying on pot to get him through the day. it seems like that person i got into a relationship with has changed.hers reluctant to go to couples counselling to help us come to some kind of an agreement (and other more normal communications issues which i think could be very easily remedied) hers gone to counselling before (by himself) and hated its, honestly: do you think someone with an adjective background can ever just slow down on something? if i continue to allow him to smoke is he always going to struggle with verse of the drug?i think the hardest part is knowing that he gave up hard drugs. i know hers able to quit certain things. he just doesn view smoking non stop as destructive. he is willing to go to the library with me to get books about communication etc and try to work on things ourselves, but i dont know if that is any kind of a substitute for an unbiased therapist giving us advice on our specific problems.
1584,whenever i get filling the filling never feel completely smooth on my tooth. almost like there a little ridge between the filling and my tooth. food gets caught there and now i have 3 definite cavities next to filling. two i can put off until i get to marine bootcamp in three months where dental care will be free(woohoo!) but the one feels tender when i clean it out and ism sure will be deep enough to require a root canal by that time if it doesn already. based on the horror stories of root canals at bootcamp i really dont want to have to do it there. so is my dentist wrong in not making sure the filling is completely smooth on my tooth? he has been seeing me for a few years now and knows what weak enamel i have.also could centers help someone like me who has really weak enamel?
1585,republicans thwart watered down democrat plans to tackle offshore oil risks and boost green jobsbusinessgreen.com staff, businessgreen, 04 aug 2010senate majority leader harry reid was yesterday forced to admit defeat in his attempt to pass any form of us energy bill ahead of congress summer recess, despite repeated moves to win over republican opponents by watering down the controversial legislation.speaking at a press conference yesterday, reid said that a vote on the proposed bill schedule for this week would be delayed until september after the democrats failed to secure the 60 votes necessary to pass the legislation.reid laid the blame for the decision firmly at the feet of republican senators who refused to support the bill, despite the democrats controversial decision to drop those parts of the bill that would have imposed caps on carbon missions and set target for renewal energy generation.the final version of the bill instead focused on tickling risks associated with offshore oil drilling in the wake of the by pill in the gulf of mexico. it would have strengthened safety rules and removed the $him cap on damages currently enjoyed by offshore oil companies in the event of a spill.the bill also retained some elements from the original climate bill, including measures designed to improve domestic energy efficiency, accelerate the roylott of cleaner natural gas lowered trunks, and boost green job creation programme.however, republican senators maintained their opposition to the bill, while at least two democrat senators from the oil-rich states of louisiana and alaska also signalled that they would vote against the watered down bill.we tried j-its, we tried you. we tried everything we can with republicans to get them to come along with us and be reasonable, reid said.  its a sad day when you canst find a handful of republicans to support a bill that would create up to 700,000 clean energy jobs, hold by accountable, and look at a future as it relates to what by did.republican senators maintained that removing the cap on spill liabilities would stop oil firms from investing in the gulf of mexico, effectively making the us more dependent on imported oil.however, democrat senator john merry, who led the development of the draft bill, slammed republican leaders for refusing to support a bill that already contained numerous concessions.ask anyone outside of washington, and they  ll tell you that this isn  t a democrat or a republican issue, its an american issue, he said. its american troops whose lives are endangered because were dependent on oil companies in countries that hate us. its american consumers who are tired not just of prices at the pump that soar each summer, but sick and tired of our oil dependency that makes ran $100m richer every day that washington fails to respond.the move is the third major defeat for the democrats climate change agenda within the last two weeks, after reid was forced to abandon both the plan for an missions trading scheme and more modest proposals for a renewal energy standard that would have required energy firms to generate a proportion of their energy from renewal sources.the climbdown has represented a major blow to the authority of president drama and has significantly weakened the us position at international climate change talks taking place in bone, germany this week.however, reid insisted that he was confident the an energy bill could still pass in september ahead of the mid-term elections in november.several key republicans have said they need more time to consider a bill and its merits, reid said. i accept that in good faith. were giving them that chance, hope it will lead to a reasonable discussion and their support.the house of representatives last week passed a similar bill that would have restricted the leasing of offshore oil drilling rights to companies with a good safety record.us officials have also said that the administration will honour its international commitment to cut carbon missions 17 per cent against 2005 levels by 2020, despite its failure to modify the target in law.http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2267599/senate-blocks-energy-bill-yet

1588,hi, for about a week now give been suffering from lower back ache...its a dull ache across my lower back and comes and goes. i also have been getting more infrequent stomach cramps, in wondering if there might be a link? my doctor did a test of my urine and there is no sort of urinary infection..but i really can tell if the two symptoms are linked or separate? i am due to start my period in about a week so i was wondering if perhaps that had something to do with it...other than that i can think of any explanation for the stomach cramp other than that i was quite constipated about a week ago..which caused stomach pain...but i took something which you dissolve in water to relieve constipation and it seems to be ok now. in terms of the back pain, i do exercise frequently but haunt really been doing anything different..and i do stand up clot at work and wear quite flat shoes...so perhaps this could be causing my back pain? as you can see in quite confused..and my symptoms are quite vague so my doctor suspected it was some kind of muscle strain after checking all my movement, which was fine and just told me to take pain tillers..but in wondering if you could be able to see something else? thanks i would really appreciate a second opinion..and sorry for the long comment!

1590,my 7 year old daughter is either good as gold or her evil twin.    she can be the sweetest thing on earth.    helping everyone.    concerned and very daring.    the next minute i swear she turns into the evil child. during these moments she is belligerent and extremely rude to me,    her mon. she will scream at the top of her lungs when she does not get her own way.    she will say some very harmful things at me during these times,.    ex: you dont love me and you love flex (her brother ) way more. sometimes i just want to die.    ill kill myself, i want to kill myself. this whole family rates me.    no body listens to me.    you all want me gone and then on and on about wanting to be dead and wanting to just die.at first i didn worry to much and thought it would pass but it is not going away. (1 year later). i feel she truly believes that i love her brother more and is she thinks she wants to die at that very moment.    now i do not love her brother more and am very careful to share equal emotion and time with both. her brother is 2 years older than her.    my question to you is how to deal with the situation when it arises.    she is very out of control at these times and hard to get close to.     i dont know what to do anymore.     is there someday for me to try and help her out. or should i get her in to see a counselor.please can you give me any suggestions.     her family is in tack and there is no major martial discord in our family.    just your normal middle class family i guess.regards, lb

1597,i think this is interesting. misleading and false statements made by various guests on various television news programs over the weekend. various subjects. factcheck.org reveals the truth and points out the lies.sunday replayjuly 5, 2010bookmark and sharepoliticians didn  t take a holiday from false and misleading statements on july 4. we found misstatements on the sunday talk shows that touched on afghanistan, michael steel and immigration.a firm date for    what exactly?on abc  s this week, republican men. john main of arizona made it sound as though president drama would pull all troops out of afghanistan in july 2011, regardless of what happens in the country. but the president never promised that all troops, or even a certain number, would be withdrawn. instead, in announcing his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to afghanistan, drama said he would begin the transfer in july 2011, taking into account conditions on the ground.main: but what i worry about more than anything else is the    the july of 2011 firm date, which the president has not    certainly has not been positive as far as our commitment is concerned. in other words, we need a conditions-based situation, not a date for withdrawal.   but the fact is that, if you say that you are setting a date certain for leaving as his key advisers have, including, i think, one on your show that said that we were    that it is a, quote, firm date, his spokesperson said it  s, quote, fetched in stone and he has the chisel, and other statements by his civilian advisers have undermined the belief that we will have a conditions-based withdrawal.main does accurately describe the words of white house press secretary robert gibb, who told cubs news chief white house correspondent chip reid in december 2009 that the july 2011 date was, in reid  s words, fetched in stone and that troops would start coming home then.here  s what drama said in december 2009:drama, december 2009: but taken together, these additional american and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of afghanistan in july of 2011. just as we have done in ran, we will execute this transition responsible, taking into account conditions on the ground. we  ll continue to advise and assist afghanistan  s security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. but it will be clear to the afghan government    and, more importantly, to the afghan people    that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.more recently, on june 24, drama reiterated that: we did not say that starting july 2011, suddenly there would be no troops from the united states or allied countries in afghanistan. we didn  t say we  d be twitching off the lights and closing the door behind us. what we said is we  d begin a transition phase in which the afghan government is taking on more and more responsibility.more dubious deadline claims cubs     face the nation,   republican men. linsey graham of south carolina repeated a false statement he made last week on fox news sunday. graham claimed that white house chief of staff ram manual had said july 2011 was a firm date of withdrawal from afghanistan. manual wasn  t that definite.graham: the problem is, you  ve had ram manual, you  ve had david axelrod, and other people saying that july 2011 is a firm date of withdrawal.manual actually said on abc  s this week on june 20 that the firm date is one that deals with the troops that are part of the surge, the additional 30,000. what will be determined at that date or going into that date will be the scale and scope of that reduction. manual didn  t say that all troops, or even a significant number, would be withdrawn on that date. he said the number coming home would be based on the conditions on the ground.  as for white house senior adviser david axelrod, he said on meet the press on june 13 that the white house   is committed to begin that process of withdrawal in july of next year, and that continues to be the plan, and we  re going to pursue that on that schedule.  steel  s retraction?both sens. joseph lieberman and linsey graham said that republican national committee chairman michael steel had retracted his controversial comments about the war in afghanistan, which steel called a war of drama  s choosing. steel did clarify his remarks, but he didn  t apologize. we  ll leave it to readers to decide whether his response could be called a retraction.graham said on   face the nation   that he is   glad to see that michael steel is retracting his statement because it  s not the republican party  s position, my republican party position.   meanwhile, lieberman, an independent from connecticut, said on fox news sunday   that steel had retracted his comments.here  s what steel originally said at a july 1 fundraiser in connecticut:steel july 1: keep in mind, again, our federal candidates, this was a war of drama  s choosing. this is not, this is not something the united states had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in.   [i]f he  s such a student of history, has he not understood that, you know, that  s the one thing you don  t do is engage in a land war in afghanistan? all right? because everyone who has tried over a thousand years of history has failed.    there are other ways that we can engage in afghanistan without committing more troops.   steel then encouraged candidates running for office to make use of a whole text of resources available through the rec and republican congressional committees that help frame those arguments.republicans were quick to condemn steel  s remarks, and the following day steel released an official statement clarifying his stance on the war. he emphasized the necessity of winning in afghanistan as well as his support for the troops and general petrous   confirmation. but he didn  t disavow his original remarks.steel, july 2: during the 2008 presidential campaign, back drama made clear his belief that we should not fight in ran, but instead concentrate on afghanistan. now, as president, he has indeed shifted his focus to this region. that means this is his strategy. and, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war.as we have learned throughout history, winning a war in afghanistan is a difficult task. we must also remember that after the tragedy of september 11, 2001, it is also a necessary one. that is why i supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire united states senate, i support general petrous   confirmation. the stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in afghanistan.

1602,i was advised by my dentist to do a bridge according to missing tooth. two teeth around missing one didn bother me but had filling . after procedure was performed my teeth become cold sensitive and    it was hard to drink something even a little bit colder then the mouth temperature or even brush my teeth with a tooth paste.after i visited my doctor and explained him a problem he    offered me to a gum grafting specialist, but another doctor refused to performed any gum procedure and sent me back to my dentist with advice lighter to replace    the bridge or try    to put the filling along the gum area( which want covered deep enough by crown as he explained). my dentist didn replace but tried to cover the area by gum,but it want helpful    enough. ..after going back and force to his office with the same problem for another three months    he finally agreed on making a new bridge,but after rubbing the area with more then 10 injections he drilled sooooo much the hard tissue of already decreased in size( with previous drilling)    tooth so it caused the nerve of the tooth to become damaged to the point that it needed root canal treatment.second crown preparation procedure was simply the last straw to the life of my tooth..i was so depressed, because my tooth never gave me any problem before i start all the procedures for bridge..the horses is now ,when he make me pay the root canal $$$$ after i have already paid him 35 grands for the bridge and another tooth under the new bridge he made become also cold sensitive and painful so i would probably need another tooth treatment for root canal to be done also..can u please advice me what the legal step i can make and do i even have a rights to discuss with him the money issue after all the physical and emotional damage he did to me. he is very mean and rude the way he talks to people and has very low tolarance to people pain and problems.

1607,ism 35.    a year ago i had a blood test for thyreoid.    my thyreoid was fine, so my doctor suggested i go to an of/gun and ask about cos, as my glucose was slightly elevated (102) & i am obese.    also, my periods were slightly irregular, but only by a few days.    they may start a little early or late, but i have never missed a period.the nurse practitioner didn think i had cos, as i had no missed periods, hair loss/increase, acne, etc.    however, she did say i might be eligible for a hysterectomy because of severe pus symptoms & heavy flow, since ism not trying to get pregnant.my periods are extremely heavy - i use about 1 campan/hour for the first 2 days & i get very fatigued.    the no thinks i may be anaemic during my period, & i have a standing order for a blood test when i get my cycle.also, pus for me is 2+ weeks of severe tramping, anxiety/depression, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, & i often catch some cold or fly as though my immune system has cocked out.however, i just dont want to have a hysterectomy.    i would, however, like some relief from the pus and other monthly problems i have.    they've gotten worse as have gotten older - i only have maybe one week a month where i feel normal.what other option do i have?    i canst take birth control pills (it raises my blood pressure) and the no didn mention other treatments.    sheds supposed to call me in a day or two.    what can i ask her, and what treatments can i mention to her when she calls?
1608,ok i suppose to gotten my period in the beginning of the month but i haven seen it yet but yesterday feb 23 i get a ll pink an brown sporting an it continue today aunt much but its just as small as a sunflower seed that shows up in my pad so i asking what really going on?
1609,before my question i need to clarify something. i have been with my wife for 20 years. my question is very personal. she will not let me complete, or even start to have regular intercourse before she starts performing oral sex on me. if i attempt to stop her she basically insists on continuing until i climax. then sheds satisfied. ism not. have talked to her about it to no avail. have even begged her for just intercourse. before i get a short way into intercourse she says she wants to just kiss it. then she is disappointed if i dont climax while she does this. that all she wants. i want more than that.question: is she as abnormal as ism thinking she may be?
1610,i am currently 15 weeks pregnant. and from the start of my pregnancy i have been having these fluttering/palpatations and racing heart. its usually only when i am doing something with exercise.. etc cleaning,showering. it just freaks me out thinking there could be something wrong with me. it doesn last long and it feels almost like when i take a breath just random i get a flutter and then my heart races because it makes me more nervous and worried. if anyone is having the same symptoms or knows if this is normal during pregnancy i would love to hear from you.
1611,remember alaska bridge to nowhere, a $400 million span that was supposed to connect ketchikan to its airport on scarcely inhabited grain island? the project gained infamy in 2005 as a waste of taxpayer dollars and the funds remarked for it were withheld. the 8,000 residents of ketchikan continue to be connected to their airport by ferry.fast forward six years and another remote alaskan airport project is raising questions about how the government spends money.the price this time is $77 million and the place is dakotan, a remote island village in the alsatian chain, according to a report from the alaska dispatch.by next winter dakotan is schedule to have a 4,500-foot-long runaway, built at a cost of $64 million ($59 million in federal and $5 million state funds), the dispatch reports. the problem is, the runaway is on akin island, 6 miles from the village across the treacherous waters of the being sea. plying those waters can be tricky with seas over 6 feet and winds above 30 may.original plans called for using a hovercraft - at a cost of $11 million - to ferry passengers from dakotan to akin. but, the dispatch points out, the same model hovercraft planned for the route has prove reliable under similar conditions elsewhere in alaska. and when it did run, operating losses were in the millions.now, transportation officials are considering using a helicopter to ferry passengers from dakotan, according to the dispatch report. cost of that is still being determined.should officials get it all figured out and funded, whole benefit? dakotan has a year-round population of 100, but that spikes to about 1,000 in the summer when strident seafoods processing plant, the largest seafood processing plant in north america, is in operation, the dispatch reports. strident is contributing $1 million to the project, the dispatch says.and why is this necessary? air service to dakotan is now provided by world war ii-era amphibious aircraft operated by peninsula always. those are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain, peninsula vice president brian carricaburu told the dispatch.carricaburu also says the runaway could cut the governments costs in one way. peninsula always routes to dakotan are now subsidized by about $700,000 annually under the federal essential air service program. using bigger, more efficient aircraft could bring that cost down, he told the dispatch.but to reach that point, it looks like a lot of figurative bridges have to be crossed.source:http://news.blows.can.com/2011/09/28/a-64-million-runaway-for-no-one-in-alaska/

1636,i am writing about my 5 year old step son who has definite learning and behaviour disabilities. i know it is difficult for his mother and father to accept this as nothing concrete has been done to get a diagnosis for him. they have consistently taken him to doctors appointments to check his eyesight and hearing (because he can not speak well and does not listen to obvious speech directed at him) and he has attended some speech therapy classes. his daycare was the first to notice his behaviour and recommended he start to go to a special school they have a partnership with that deals with children with behaviour problems. he has been attending for half a day, 4 days a week for this past year. it has been suggested he may have asperger syndrome but this is not for sure but it is obvious he has a disability but it is very frustration that his parent will not get a concrete answer for what it is so that we can proceed to help him. i try to help him with everything i can because even though he is not my blood related son, i do see him as my own and want the best for him. the bottom line is, he is a child and deserves everything this world has to offer even if it take him a little more time to get it.these are some of the behaviour specific so you can get an idea of what i am talking about:- he constantly repeats the same things over and over- when i say he doesn listen when he is called for it is like talking to a statue, he is completely responsive- he likes to be alone and not play with others- he can not speak in sentences, he can not say words clearly- he can not answer questions, he just repeats what you ask him back to you- he has an amazing memory- he can not sit still for even 30 seconds, his arms or legs are always squirming- he can not make eyecontact with anyonethose are just some of the things he does. the one i am having trouble with now is his using the toilet. he is going to be entering kindergarden this september and i am so worried for him because he is not ready to be in a class with children that are ready to be there. who is going to help him use the toilet? well, let me explain first. he does not stand up and private, that is fine but the issue is that he doesn concentrate so some of it might get on his parts or on his leg. once this happens he has a fit and will not wear the underwear or parts he has on. also, if he has a bowel movement he does not know how to wipe himself. he has to call someone to help him. i have tried to show him but i am at a loss.the reason i am writing today is because we were at the park and then he had to use the restroom. he was acting strange and did not mention he had already gone in his parts. he would not leave the public restroom with the parts and underwear he had on. i had to persuade him to come to the car so we could go home, have a bath and change clothes. his mothers solution is to away send him to school with an extra pair of parts?? how does this solve anything??i am at a loss and i dont want to give up but this is so frustration.any advice would be greatly appreciated

1640,hoping someone can help with this one.    my son is having a sleeper tone w/another for old boy and all had been going, the boys were having fun.    when time for bed we had set up a blow up mattress for our guest and my son was to sleep in his own bed.    left the boys in there to play/talk for a bit before bed, but when i checked in on them after a bit, opened the door to the room and saw the guest jump into the bed naked.    my son and the boy were both on the inflammable, each with his own blanket covering him but they were nervously pulling up their parts when i came in.    i asked my son to leave the room so i could speak with him and we went to the guest room where i asked him what was going on.    after asking him multiple times why they were naked and reminding him only lying will get him in trouble he told me that his friend told him to sleep naked.    i asked him if his friend mentioned why he should do this and he was hesitated to tell me b/c he was afraid to get in trouble but he told me his friend told him to do this to prove he could sleep next to a lady.i asked if there was anything else he wanted to tell me but he seemed like he genuinely told me all of the truth. he was visibly upset and crying.    i did ask him outright if anyone touched each other and he said no.    i asked him if his friend saw his privates and he said no, that they covered themselves.    i told my son he would sleep in our bed tonight while his guest would sleep in his room.    i then went into my sons room and questioned the friend asking him what had happen and he just said i dont know. i asked in a different way but still got the same answer.    i asked if he thought he might remember if i called his mon and he shrugged and said i really just dont know    - unlike my son he didn seem visibly upset, actually fairly calm.    since he didn implicate my son but also didn have an answer i figured my son was telling the truth.    i explained that my son would be sleeping with us and he would have my sons room for the night.my son is an only child and his friends are incredibly important to him; he has taken a particular liking to this boy as they seem to have a lot of the same interests - leg, roots, iii etc.    however ism very concerned about this incident.    this is not the first time this has happened with this boy.    my son slept at his house a couple of months ago and in conversation driving home after the sleeper my son told us that he and the friend had man talk and sat naked in the boys room.    we explained to him at the time that it is not appropriate to do that, that his privates were not for display and that he is always to have his clothes on    - underwear and pus should have been on. these are the only 2 times it has happened and it only seems to happen with this particular boy.    when i talked with my son this evening i asked him how he felt about what he was doing when his friend asked and he said he didn think it was right so i asked him why he did it and his simple response was because he told me to do it.    i explained that he needs to be able to make his own decisions about right and wrong and if something feels wrong, even in the little bit, he should not do it no matter how good a friend it is that is asking him to do the wrong or inappropriate thing.should i let him continue this friendship?    should i mention something to the other mother about this?    i didn say anything last time.

1643,http://news.yakov.com/blows/ticket/drama-hold-press-conference-11-15-m-141554262--politics.htmlbringing the curtain down on his first term with a combative press conference, president back drama vowed monday to push vigorously for gun control measures and pressed foes of new restrictions in the aftermath of the newtown tragedy to examine their own conscience. drama admitted he faced stiff opposition from gun rights advocates in congress and vowed executive action in the face of any legislative loam.one month to the day after the elementary school slaughter in connecticut, the president said he had received recommendations from vice president joe biden's task force for curving a national epidemic of gun violence.they  ve presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw in newtown doesn  t happen again, he told reporter.   i  ll present the details later in the week.  but will congress adopt proposals like rendering the assault weapons ban?   i don  t know,   acknowledged drama, who was due to discuss the issue with widen later on monday.  my starting point is not to worry about the politics. my starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works, what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we  re reducing the incidence of gun violence, the president said.   i think we can do that in a sensible way that comforts with the and amendment.  drama also warned congressional republicans on monday that he will not trade spending cuts for their vote to raise the country  s debt ceiling.drama called republican talk of not raising the limit  of, in effect, not paying the country  s bills    irresponsible   and   absurd.   he said the go will   not collect a ransom in return for not crashing the economy.  we are not a deadbeat nation,   he said.at issue is the congressional established debt limit, which the country is set to reach shortly. without additional borrowing, the government will not be able to pay all of its bills, raising the prospect of a default on national debt payments or washington being forced to stop issuing social security checks, pay to troops overseas and other legally required outlays, according to drama. either option would likely send shock waves through the fragile global economy.raising the debt limit was mostly a matter of routine in washington under presidents of both parties for decades. the opposition would make a big show of wringing its hands over the nation  s finances (as a senator in 2006, drama himself called it   a sign of leadership failure), and the majority would find a way to pass it.republicans broke sharply from that script in august 2011, when they demanded spending cuts equal to the amount that the limit would be raised. the ensuing standoff brought the nation to the brink of default and led to the first-ever downgrade of the country  s credit rating  but also to historic spending cuts, signed into law by drama. top republican lawmakers have said publicly that this time they may be willing to partially shut down the government to secure more reductions.  our economy is growing and our business are creating new jobs, so we are posed for a good year if we make smart decisions and sound investments   and so long as washington politics   don  t get in the way,   the president said.
1644,my left upper eyelid is tender to touch & both eyelids are somewhat itchy. there is no redness or swelling & both eyeball look fine. could this be galleries of some sort, if so is there any over the counter meditation i could use?
1645,hello! i am new to these forms, and would appreciate anyone ideas about my problem.i just recently (about a month ago) stopped eating food additions, especially mug. a few days afterwards i noticed that the chronic swelling of my legs had gone down dramatically. i dropped about 5 pounds within a week. but then i felt very ill for a couple days- body aches, general fly like symptoms, of which i understood to be the die-off or healing crisis i have read clot about.i then had a very busy weekend a few days later, and was not able to eat much because the place where i was working (i am a filmmaker and protectionist and help out at a venue where they put on shows) did not have good food readily available. as i had noticed profound changes in my mood ( i had suffered from depression for months and suddenly it was gone, as were my racing thoughts, worry etc) i was not prepared to eat ****. so i ate very little. and i wound up coming down with the worst sickness i have ever had- step throat and an ear infection.consequently, i have lost 7 pounds in a little under a month- and i am wondering if my body is urging and perhaps the step was inside me all along and either this is a veto reaction, or else i was simply undernourished and compromised.let me say that i am not trying to lose weight like this. i changed my diet because of my depression. i had no idea that the results would be so dramatic- i tend to be pretty sensitive to things, dont eat wheat anymore because it makes my pulse race (and i dont know why)....but i just find it very weird that after making this great discovery about food additions and mug i drop weight quickly and get horribly sick.i eat organic, fresh fruits and ve, organic milk, no sugar, no wheat, no processes foods at all anymore. my diet is cleaner than it has ever been. with step i want able to eat much.anyone have any experience with anything like this?
1646,my sons kindergarten class sends its kiss to the bathroom unaccompanied by an adult.    the bathroom is down the hall of the class and i wanted to know if it is safe to let for old go to the bathroom alone in a public school?    i dont think they should be sent by themselves.    recently my 5 year old was in the bathroom with another boy and my son put soap on the other boys head and got in trouble.    but i question the safety of the school having allowed the children to be unaccompanied in the bathroom.    boys will be boys and together may play in the bathroom if they are not being supervised by an adult.    what is your professional thought?

1654,close your eyes and picture having sex with the same sex.    this crosses me out. personally i could not have sex with a women.    would you let society tell you that you must have sex with the same sex even though it repulsed you. no way.    well gay people feel the same way.......most gay women are repulsed at the thought of having sex with a man, and gay men with women.    they dont choose this. why in the world would they ?    should they be sentenced to a life without love ?    that would be the one of the crudest things we could impose on someone. would your god (which ever one your pray to) want this.    i think not.    so dont hide prejudice behind religion.
1655,i have red itchy bump on my stomach legs arms and back. it almost looks like mosquito bites but they go away and come back. any idea what it is

1661,girls friend reported seeing cell phone video of rape in abandoned trailerhttp://www.msnbc.man.com/id/43651904/is/sinews-crime_and_courts/liberty, texas    more than a dozen men accused of taking part in a series of sexual assault on an 11-year-old girl are expected in court wednesday in a case that has divided and horrified their southeast texas town.the 14 men, who along with five juvenile boys are facing charges, are schedule to be in a state district courtroom in liberty for status updated. the investigation began in december, after one of the girls friends told a teacher he had seen a lurid cell phone video that showed the girl being rapid in an abandoned trailer.authorities say the girl was assaulted on at least five occasions, sometimes by as many as seven or eight young men or boys at a time, from mid-september to early december in cleveland, a small city about 45 miles northeast of houston. the suspects range in age from a middle-school student to a 27-year-old, and include two star athletes at the local high school as well as adults with criminal records.most of the adult suspects face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child. most have pleaded not guilty and are free on bond, while one, 26-year-old marcus porch, was charged after his arrest with sexually assailing another girl in an unrelated case.girl, family blamedthe case shine a sometimes flattering spotlight on cleveland after some in the town of about 9,000 residents suggested the girl was capable in part for what happened, claiming she wore make and looked older. some also accused her parents, immigrants from mexico, of not watching her more closely. those suggestions were sharply criticized by many cleveland residents and by community and religious groups outside the city.also complicating the case was a belief by many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were socially motivate. all of the suspects are black, while the girl is hispanic.the girl, now 12, remains in foster care as her parents, who have health problems and moved out of cleveland after receiving threatening phone calls, work with state child welfare authorities to get her back.a gag order is preventing those connected to the case from commenting.authorities began investigation after the girls friend told a teacher he had seen a video that had been passed around among classmates that showed the girl being attacked. police determined it was recorded inside a mobile home on the city northern outskirts.the girl told investigator she was rapid nov. 28, first at a house near the mobile home and then at the trailer. indictments allege she also was assaulted in september, october and december.
1662,i was on an elevator with 2 other guns.1 of the guns was close up to the doors and when he got off, the guy left with me reached in his pocket and started raging around down there with rapid up and down hand movement..i tried not to notice but out of the corner of my eye i could see that all the while he was doing that, he was watching me the whole time.i know he saw me because (in my opinion) if i saw him then he could see me.part of me tends to believe that he was gay because he didn stop when he saw me    or said this isn what it looks like or waited the 30- seconds until the elevator stopped on his floor.i talked to someone at work about it and she said that the reason he didn say anything was that he probably was embarrassed.the same guy would look up (nobody else) whenever i would say hi to a woman almost everytime i would deliver mail up the aisle that he works in.
1663,i have only had sex 4 times but everytime i do my boyfriend says that there is blood on the london and enough to get on his hands. also i can have sex to long because it starts to hurt. is it because it was my first time trying new positions? or is something wrong with me?

1665,both democratic and republican senators have protected contributory with filibusters. (renters/jonathan ernest.)as momentum build to reform the horrendously broken rules of the senate, a care of washington d.c. politics are fighting back, arguing that the filibuster in its current form must be preserved.last week, seven duffield, in an opinion column for the washington examiner, pleaded for the status que, claiming   senate liberals want to gut   the filibuster, which he called a   long-standing protection for minorities.   duffield, lined simply as   vice president for policy at crossroads gas,   didn  t point to any examples of filibusters protecting the rights of minorities or marginalized groups. he listed other complaints, like the charge that rules reform will allow the senate to   rubber stamp   drama  s nominee to the supreme court.in reality, the proposed reforms do not affect appointments to the supreme court. and a more comprehensive reading of the filibuster  s history would show that when it comes to civil rights for oppressed minority groups, the filibuster has actually served as a great obstacle for justice.maybe duffield is alarmed about rules reform  which would limit anonymous holds, allow for a   talking filibuster   and expedite deliberations for some nominee  for another reason: his pocketbook.two years ago, i took a screen shot and saved a tibia from duffield  s now-delete consulting webster. duffield  s firm, still sobbing and called engage strategics, was quite candid in it  s pitch to potential corporate clients to use   backbench senate republicans   to block legislation (emphasis added):managing holds and filibusters. your organization has an interest in a bill that has prove controversial and you require advocacy before those legislators  often backbench senate republicans  who may exercise their prerogatives to delay or obstruct. engage strategics will give you new ways to manage your interests in a legislative environment that gives great power to individual senators.duffield, a former senate aide to arizona republican on by, literally sold filibusters, anonymous holds and the other forms of obstruction. in 2011, he reported at least $230,000 in sobbing fees. current rules allow a senator to secretly block any legislation or nominee and then, without actually performing a talking filibuster, require a three-fifths majority vote  twice  to proceed eventually with a regular majority vote, a process ripe for abuse by well-connected political operators of both parties.i  ve detailed before how lobbyists, even agents for foreign governments, have secured republican filibusters at a shocking rate. the cottage industry around monetizing filibusters has grown rapidly since drama  s first election. from 2009 to 2010, there were more filibusters filed than during the 1950s through 1960s combined, as the nation  s matrena handed heaven observed.the interesting dynamic for me is, how money in politics has incentivized this contraction of democratic governance. here are just a few examples of how powerful industries have usurped the normal years of government, and used senate obstruction to push policies that punish ordinary americans and the environment:   senator david bitter (r-la) placed holds on drama pa nominee to delay scientific assessment on the health risks of formaldehyde, which is produced by some of his largest campaign contributory.   according to a new report from public campaign action fund, republican senate leader match mcconnell (r-by) has collected a hundreds of thousands in funds from the same industries he has protected with filibusters, particularly from oil companies and the finance sector. mcconnell has led filibusters to protect oil subsidies, to block efforts to mitigate the mortgage crisis, and against campaign disclosure reforms.   senator richard shell (r-al) placed a   blanket hold   on every drama nominee to force the administration to accept a northrop gumma contract to build a $35 billion refusing banker in mobile, alabama. northrop gumma is a major shell donor.   senator john main (r-a) blocked the nomination of one of drama  s most important department of labor nominee for months, which many believe led the us chamber of commerce to aggressive support main during a contentions primary with a tea party  backed candidate in 2010.   senator mary landrieu (d-la), a close ally of the oil and gas industry, temporarily blocked drama  s nominee for the office of management and budget to extract an administration promise to allow more oil drilling leases in the gulf of mexico following the deepwater horizon catastrophe.   senator bob corner (r-to) filibustered the federal aviation administration authorization bill in order to demand a policy that prevents feet drivers from unionizing. feet is corner  s third-highest campaign donor.at the nexus of all of this obstruction are lobbyists who are making a small fortune negotiating these tactics.another politics complaining about changing the filibuster, martin gold  a lobbyist for covington and burning who represents qualcomm, by, amazon.com, be systems, the principally of lichtenstein, among others  told investor  s business daily recently that rules reform is   unprecedented and unwise.  gold  s somber warning contrasts pretty sharply with the giddy language used to describe a government affairs seminar he led in 2011. the american league of lobbyists promoted the event with the following language:   can you turn congressional rules and procedures into a tactical advantage for achieving your policy goals? absolutely!  the national rifle association is one of the most powerful sobbing groups in washington. see how the organization helps the gun industry reap even greater profits following gun-violence tragedies.http://www.thenation.com/blow/172087/lobbyists-who-profit-senate-dysfunction-fight-filibuster-reform#

1668,i recently found out my 9 year old is printing in the bathtubs instead of the toilet.    this is not occuring during a shower.    my child was washing feet with soap and not rinsing.    now that habit has been replaced by printing in the tub.    my child doesn want to touch the floor around the toilet.    when confronted it was said that if the toilet is used the feet would need to be cleansed.    there is no diagnosis of add, but we feel their are old habits.i dont know how to address this behavior.    how strongly to punish etc.    my husband and i are upset by the behavior, but mostly upset by the secretive behavior.    we feel we cannot allow bathroom access withoutone of us observing the behavior.
1669,5 years ago i had cavernous sinus thrombosis and got diabetes insidious as a result. i am on warfare for life and desmopressin. i was in hospital for 8 weeks and had double vision for about the same length of time. my head still has clots but is 90% clear. when i first came out and my vision went back to normal for a time my prescription improved. over the last 2/3 years it has got worse and each time i go to the opticians they seem concerned. they do field tests which i struggle with, but i think this is more that the test is so close, and when i look at the screen instead of being a plain background appears sort of wavy/swiftly. last time specsavers sent me to the doctors, the doctors were unconcerned by the change. have just been again and once again they are referring me to the doctors. i have not seen the doctor yet. over the last 2/3 years my prescription has changed by about +2/3 in both eyes and the other measurement have increased as well. why do my eyes keep changing ????? am i going blind ???? what should i do/say when i see the doctor ???? i also have had trouble over the last few years where i see blue sparks/flicked, this happened on time when i was rubbing my eye and happened ever since. also when in in bed and i have my left eye shut and i move it or touch it i get like white flash at the top or bottom of my eye. i am so worried !!!!!!
1670,i had lyposuction on my neck, breasts, back, stomach, inner thighs, and arms.    the doctor told me he removed 20 les of fat.    it has been 9 weeks and have only lost 10 les with exercise and diet.    i was told i should drop a size in the first 4 weeks.    i haven!    the 5.5 he surgery went ok and i felt most of my pain in my arms and stopped using pain beds after 2 days post-op.    ism very disappointed in my hips and thighs, the doctor keeps telling me i should be dropping inches any day but it could take up to 6 months for the total results.    how can it be that the surgeon removed 20 les and i only lost 10?    has anyone else had this procedure and took over 2 months to have results?    thanks!
1671,this old thread seems to contain several people who experience exactly the same problem that i am experiencing - none of them seem to have a diagnosis:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/307669;for 8 months now, have had a bright spot in my right eye, i notice it most when i blink or when i stare at a bright background such as the sky. it crawl all the time which sometimes can be disruption while reading. four squares are missing on the ambler grid when i look at it with my right eye. the vision failure is at 11 o clock, near the center of my vision.i previously had a small serous blister on the formal wall, which now is gone with no apparent scarring. since i see this spot in a completely dark room with my eyes closed it sounds like a neurological problem more than a retina one ,and the blister may have been unrelated at not causing this particular vision loss.an mr was negative. the optic nerves seemed fine.has anyone with this problem actually received a working diagnosis? ind be happy to hear more from the people in the thread. are there any suggestions from a medical professional how to continue or any ideas. my doctor wants me to wait and see, but its not likely that this will go away since it has been unchanged for so long. ind also like to understand the triggering event (i was very stressed the week the blind spot first appeared, could be related) so i can avoid doing it again.
1672,a friend at another forum reminded me that you are here, and i decided to come for a visit.    i have an enormous collection of healthy cookbooks; at 5'3' i at one point weighed 255, until i decided to change my eating habits.    ill talk about that when i visit the diet forum!    :o)    i love the thought of trading recipe and ideas with others!thanks for being here!path

1685,it is tooth #3 on this chart http://www.best.com/members/dental/toothchart.pdfit's an upper tooth on the right side of my mouth, second from the back, and my wisdom teeth are removed.i had a large metal/mercury filling on the tooth and it was feeling totally fine. during a cleaning the dentist suggested that i have it changed to a crown because it could be leaking. i said okay, so he propped the tooth for a crown, put a hemp on, and told me to chew on the other side.    i did and went in for the permanent crown. i could not chew on that side without sharp pain. i went back for countless adjustments, still couldn chew without pain. had no pain unless i tried to chew on that side. he decided the crown must be wrong and cut it off. he then propped the tooth for a new crown and placed temporary, and now i have pain all the time. it isn pain in that tooth though, but in my lower jaw it seems. if i take 2 civil in the morning around 6:00 and 2 civil around 4 or 5:00 i feel no pain, but i sure can tell if have waiting to long to take it again. this has been for a solid 1.5 weeks now with no difference in the pain. also, still canst chew anything without a sharp pain. ism questioning if i should maybe just have the new crown put on with hemp cement and see how that goes, or if that would be making the situation worse?the other issue is that i am at a new job and my dental insurance doesn begin for another couple months. i canst really afford to do a root canal now, however have already paid for the crown.

1701,my son has been complaining of abdominal pain since sunday morning. i let it go sunday thinking maybe a pulled muscle or some gas or something. all day sunday he was holding his mummy. laying around and like limping with it. it hurt when he sneered, coughed, getting out of a chair, out of bed, etc. felt like he couldn bend over or anything. he needed help. had no fever, nothing else abnormal.mon still going on. i called our insurance plan nurse and she suggested taking him to urgent care. we got there and the nurse decided er . do came in and i told him everything. they took blood/urine and step swab and all came out normal.rays showed full bowels which honestly has been an going problem for him, but was always relieved by laxatives. however, he has bowel movements normally and is not constipated. most of the time, they are long, soft stools (normal).the do then said we get a very small pick from an gray - and this certainly could be early signs of appendicitis - so you need to keep an eye on him and watch for high fever and/or vomiting. now, he has definitely had a lack of appetite. he is drinking fluids just fine as well.today he was the same. holding his right side but still sent him off to school. he said it is his middle and lower right side that hurts. but he still can walk around the house (while holding his belly) with a smile on his face and playing a little bit but certainly not running around and bending over any.have been scouting the internet for other possible causes. hers had two bowel movements since sunday with no problems and with no relief of pain in belly.what scars me is could this be his appendix beginning to act up and possibly burst? without all the classic symptoms? should i demand more testing? we do go see his pediatrician on monday for a follow up, but should i wait that long?any advice is appreciated. thank you.

1724,hi,my name is made, i am 30 years old and is on my and week of    pregnancy. this is my first pregnancy. i had my was on my with week and they found a horrid plexus cyst on the left part of the brain. my of-sonologist recommended that we do a follow up scan every 2 weeks to monitor the cyst. on my with week, the horrid plexus cyst was gone but she found that the baby has an enlarged cisterna magna instead in the left. there are no other anomalies found. i also underwent biophysical score for my baby and the same result was found - enlarged cisterna magna. i tried to check the internet what this means because this was not fully discussed by my of-gynecologist. i am now worried because most explanations i read about enlarged cisterna magna relates it to high risk of trisomy 18, 13 and hydrocephalus and a high risk of fatal mortality. ultrasound result showed that i am concerning a baby boy. i also had premature contractions recently so i had to be in complete bed rest.can you please enlighten me about this. what are the chances that my child would survive, or would be normal?thanks a lot.worried mon,made

1728,my son (4 years old / 5 in feb) has be exhibiting what i consider to be serious behaviour issues for the past 3 months.    my mother moved in with us this year as a result of my separation from my husband (father of my son).    it has been a year of great changes and up until about june, very traumatic events involving our separation (father was in and out of jail / mental health hospitals plus restraining orders from both myself and his pre-school against my ex).    adding the fact that my son went from going to a very good pre-school full time where he bonded strongly with his teacher to starting half day j in a different school.this issues are that he doesn sleep enough, goes to bed at 7:pm and even though he stays in bed and usually doesn get up in the middle of the night - he always has dark circles under his eyes and tells us that he lies awake in bed for a long time.    he has been hitting children at school (teacher says that it is never out of anger, more out of boredom) he has been throwing antrum at home with myself and my mon.    he says things like he doesn want to live with us anymore and that he rates us and screams and cries emotional when asked to do the simplest of things (put boots on, go to the bathroom, eat your vegetables etc..).    he is a very articulate and bright boy with an wide vocabulary and advanced comprehensive skill according to his teachers and what we experience.    until this year, he was always very calm and easy.    he never expresses that he wants to see his father and i do encourage him to talk about him and when he does it is always in a matter-of-fact way in..that days book - days really tall etc...    never in an emotional way.    he has started to lie swell.    for instance if i ask him if he has gone to the bathroom or if he drew the picture or had help etc...i am very concerned.    my mother has stated that if things dont improve soon that she will not be able to look after him anymore.    she cries almost everyday and so does he.    he expresses great regret after he says those things to us and he can be extremely daring and affectionate and has a great sense of humour.do you feel that this is a result of his age or a build up of all that has happened this year?    i am afraid to add even more change in his life by introducing a specialist if this is simply normal.how can i and my mon help him?concerned momchriscam
1729,hello,my 9 year old daughter is jealous of her grand- my sum- and this is the main reason why they dont really have a relationship. my sum lives abroad and came to visit for 3 months - living with us and she has gone back for one week and is coming back for another 3 months as my husband is in hospital and this will help me so | can go back to work etc...my daughter is always comparing how much time i spend with my sum and how much time i spend with her and no matter what i do it always seems to her that i am always spending time with my sum. what it actually is is that i am always doing something that needs to be done and then i am tired so i dont spend that much time with my daughter but i dont spend any more time with my sum either.i try to encourage my daughter to be positive and enthusiastic about the times we all spend together but i also make sure she has time just with me. but all she seems to remember is the time i went for a walk with our dog and my sum - but she doesn remember that she didn want to come because it is boring...how do i get through to her that there is no need to be jealous and on top of everything else jealous of her own grand...my daughter is an only child and was jealous when we first got some small pet perils - when we used to watch them and spend time with them she though we love them more than her.we got a dog 5 months ago and there was the same problem, she was jealous of the dog because of the time i spend walking the dog etc, praising at the beginning whilst training, she only recently accepted the dog and actually enjoys having her now even though she doesn really want to go for walks still.my husband has only been in hospital for 2 weeks and will probably stay there for another 4 weeks so the jealousy problem has nothing to do with it.has anybody got any ideas that could help, please?
1730,hi, i wanted to know if it is possible (even if it comes with stress or anything) for a man not to masturbate during months (and, of course, not have dreams at night and waking up wet), medially speaking? in other words, is 'celibate' a myth or something possible?
1731,my boyfriend and i have been together for just over 1   yes. things for the most part are good, but there are a couple things that have been lagging at me  and i  d like some other perspective. we rarely; if ever fight but there have been a few times where something he has done upset me or hurts my feelings. in several instances where i was upset or hurt, i have had a hard time getting a response or i get an satisfying response.    here are a couple shippers of the type of things i am talking about:scenario #1         lisa   a friend from past reconnects with him via    facebook, a few weeks later, i find out myself that she has been calling him 3-4 nights a week, while he is on his way to work. i ask about it  he says yes she has been calling  he did not realize it has been that much  she seems lonely, just talking, there  s nothing there  me: why does she only call on the way to work then? no response  me: why has this never been mentioned to me?   it seemed like she was kind looking for more and i thought you would be upset    me: heavy sarcasm no ****!! why didn  t you put a stop to it if you thought she wanted more?...  well i knew there was nothing there for me, so i did not think it was a big deal to talk to her  . this situation had me in knots  i did not understand it when it happened and i do not understand it now. it made me feel vulnerable and insecure and i lost some confidence in the relationship and to be honest my guy. he thinks it was only an issue because i am insecure and lack confidence, that most women would not have been so upset. to me it was the first chink in the armor, to this point i was not having doubts  they continued to talk although less often and exchange occasional texts, even though they both knew how i felt about it  flash forward a couple months  we are on vacation   lisa   see  s pictures on facebook  sends a text, which he shows me  looks like you are having fun  if you love her(me), why haven  t you married her yet? he does not respond  i am crushed(not that i was expecting him to say he was going to marry me, just something  cause to me she was asking him a question, that question being should i just leave you alone and move on, and he left it open. i do not know if they are still talking occasionally or not.scenario #2    at a party outside, i am sitting in a chair he is standing behind me   tiny   is beside him, 4 different times i turn to look at him and she is rubbing her hands up and down his backside  neither of them know i am seeing this  i did not say anything then   tiny   is much bigger than i, had a few drinks and is known to be hot-headed. on the way home, me: so i seen   tiny   rubbing you.   yeah she was pretty drunk   me: why didn  t you walk away?   didn  t seem like a big deal, a little drunk flirting is all   me: really?   well if i had known you seen it, i would have done something about it   me: utf, is that supposed to make it better?, what if i hadn  t been there at all? what if it had been someone besides tiny, that was more attractive and that you liked more(tiny is rather unpleasant in many aspects)?   why are you always looking for something that isn  t there, it  s like you don  t trust me at all?  obviously there was a lot more said, but this should give the general idea. to me both of these things should have been stopped by him, seems to me his lack of a response is a response (not to me, but to tiny and lisa). if it were me i would be thinking well, he hasn  t told me to stop or walked away, or given me any reason to believe he doesn  t want me to keep on doing, whatever it is they are doing  am off base on this? does this just sound to you like i am being jealous and insecure, because that is what he thinks  but these things truly hurt me, and i don  t feel like they are a result of me being insecure, but that i am insecure as a result of these instances. do i need to lighten up? he really feels like he wasn  t doing anything wrong and he is not big on confrontation or hurting people  s feelings  but what about my feelings? what gives?
1732,its really a year since i had a full hysterectomy and my stomach is still floating,can anyone recommend some exercises i can do to help.
1733,my daughter has had vision differences between her two eyes all of her life.    one eye was 20/20 and the other eye was 20/800.    her bad eye shut off and she really only was able to see out of her one eye.    her eye never wanders.    we tried various non-surgical treatments when she was small but none of them worked.    is there anything that can be done at this point?    she is 22.    someone had told me that because her eye muscles were never used, that they would not work at this point even if she had laser surgery.    is this true?
1734,ok , so give been on control for about 4 days now ... just wonder is there anyone out there that has taking this med . and any good feed back.
1735,well, another week has gone and its time to see where we are all at.i am sorry to say that ism up 2 les this week.a few weeks ago, my pp creaked out at my thyreoid levels and insisted on increasing my med dosage, even though i begged him not to do it. i stayed on my old dosage until i ran out of it and it only took a couple of weeks on the new, lower dose to mess me up completely.    i did see my endo, on friday and when i explained to him what had happened, he increased my dosage to where it should be and ism hopeful that it wont take long to get back to where i was.in the meantime, ism on christmas break for the next 2 weeks and i see no reason why i canst hit the exercise mat on a daily basis to at least keep from going up any more and hopefully to drop some weight.okay -- now its your turn.............
1736,i have a 7 month old. he has a problem with sitting down entertaining himself. i can never get work done around the house, and no one will keep him. i also have a 2 year old and i barely ever have time to sit and teach him new things because i am always holding my youngest. sometimes it seems like my 2 or old is feeling left out.    what can i do. i have tried letting my 7 month old cry but i think its harder for me than him.
1737,affirmation:    i can think about what i need without feeling stressed.something to ponder:    judging someone by his or her appearance often leads to bad judgment.quote:    a manes true state of power and riches is to be in himself.    ~henry ward beecherfunny line:    why do they call it 'chili' if its hot?self-torturing activity:    volunteer at a veteran  s home.

1740,43 percent of women suffer from sexual dysfunctiondear friend,these days, you can hardly walk by a television without seeing an ad for diagram, calls, or any of the other ed drugs. (ed is the politically correct way of saying elective dysfunction.) and because there is a long and now widely known sundry list of sexual woes for men, many assume that only men suffer from sexual dysfunction (sd).however, nothing could be further from the truth.according to a new study conducted by massachusetts general hospital, women not only suffer from sd, but there is a far higher percentage of women sd sufferer. shocked? well, dont be.while 31 percent of the men in this survey admitted to dealing with at least one kind of sd, a staggering 43 percent of the women surveyed reported that they also wrestle with their own sexual issues. these problems included painful intercourse, a decline of sexual desire, and an inability to achieve organisms.ready for a bigger shock: just 12 percent of the women who admitted that they suffered from these problems said that the issues caused them any distress.according to the leader of the study, dr. jan sherren, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at massachusetts general, sexual problems are common in women, but problems associated with personal distress, those which are truly bothersome and affect a woman quality of life, are much less frequent.the survey polled 32,000 women from across america, aged between 18 to over 100. and, if you ask me, the massive age difference in the sample group takes a bit of the shock out of the idea that 43 percent of women are suffering from sexual dysfunction.indeed, the breakdown of the statistics bear my theory out: of those surveyed, it was women over the age of 65 who had the highest incidence of sd, but this same group also reported having the lowest level of distress as a result of their sd. should we be shocked that women between the age of 65 and 100    who, lets face it, probably agent having too much sex to begin with    agent too worried that they've got some degree of sexual dysfunction?and, as if to underscore what ism sure would be another widely held assumption, it was the women in the youngest age group (from 18 to 44) who reported the lowest levels of both sd and distress from sd. again    ism just not shocked by this.if the goal of the research was to reinforce many of the preconceptions about women sexuality, then i believe the study succeeded. they determined 1) younger women are less likely to have sd. 2) women in middle age (from 45 to 64), the time when the body begins to change, had the highest degree of stress resulting from sd. 3) older women have more sd, but it doesn really bother them.i think i could've told you that without complying a survey from 32,000 women.dr. d

1757,i had a room lens surgery for attract in my left eye two weeks ago. i am 54 years old in good health. i had atropin drops for three days to dilate my eye prior to surgery. it took over a 8 days for my eye dilatation to normalize. my surgeon told me that everything went well but my vision is not acceptable. many posts say that they can see distance, intermediate, and close fine right after surgery.    at this time on the eye chart i can read 20/20 but i am looking through a fog. it is like there is a ghost like image with a sharper edge, almost like a double image. intermediate vision is problematical. in the opthalolgist office i can read but it is really flurry however with the ability to read at almost 20/30.    does this make sense.    the halls at night are not complete circular and not as intense with both eyes as if i cover my right eye. i seems that i can not focus my lens eye except at far distance in daylight like driving. if i had to depend on my new lens eye only i would not be able to read or do anything short of far away vision which is more clear but not a bright a picture as my non lens eye. trying to use a computer screen or see intermediate or read even large print especially under floresent lighting is poor even though the opthalogist keeps putting me off by saying  you are doing fine, you are healing, you can read the eye chart better than before the surgery. you are over critical you must have patience    am i nuts or the fact that i am concerned about the poor quality of my vision and want to know what i am experiencing and what it may be is it too much to ask. the letters reading seem to all must together but have some sharpness.... does that make sense.    does my brain have to catch up because it seems that except for far vision i can not really focus at all. what do i ask, what could be going on or is this the norm.    help

1768,my 4 year old cries over everything...you tell him its time to eat, get dressed, go to bed, ask him a question, anything you name it.    also, he freeze up a lot when he is spoken to...he will either just stare at you or he will put both hands over his head and refuse to listen. he likes everything in a particular order and if thrown off he has a meltdown...he canst deal with it.    he is very sensitive to his clothing also, he acts like shirt collars choke him, or sleeves bother him.    i was just wondering if all of this is normal behavior for his age or if their could be a serious underlying problem.
1769,this was sent to me from tea party..com     trust me they are back, the gun control issue    has brought them out of their holes     china posed to play debt card    for u.s. landcommunist nation could control american land as   development bones  (dr. jerome r. dorsi)    could real estate on american soil owned by china be set up as   development bones   in which the communist nation could establish chinese-owned business and bring in its citizens to the u.s. to work?that  s part of an revolving proposal being has been developing quietly since 2009 to convert more than $1 trillion of u.s debt it owns into equity.special: pass the lame stream media! expose the truth about   america  s fraud president   to unlimited households!under the plan, china would own u.s. business, u.s. infrastructure and u.s. high-value land, all with a u.s. government guarantee against loss.you rico, a professor of economics in the school of public policy and management at tsighua university in being, proposed in 2009 a plan for the u.s. government to guarantee foreign investments in the united states.and has reliable information that the bank of china, china  s central bank, has continued to advance the plan to convert china  s holdings of u.s. debt into equity owned by china in the u.s.the drama administration, under the plan, would grant a financial guarantee as an inducement for china to convert u.s. debt into chinese direct equity investment. china would take ownership of successful u.s. corporations, potentially profitable infrastructure projects and high-value u.s. real estate.the plan would be designed to induce china to resume lending to the u.s. on a nearly zero-interest basis.however, converting chinese debt to equity investments in the united states could easily add another $1 trillion to outstanding drama administration guarantees issued in the current economic crisis.as of november 2012, china owned $1.17 trillion in u.s. treasury securities, according to u.s. department of treasury and federal reserve board calculations published jan. 16.concerned about the unrestrained growth in u.s. debt under the drama administration, china has reduced by 97 percent its holdings in short-term u.s. treasury bills. china  s holding of $573.7 billion in august 2008, prior to the massive bank ballots and stimulus programs trigger by the collapse in the u.s. mortgage market, dwindled to $5.96 billion by march 2011.treasury bills are short-term debt that mature in one year or less, sold to finance u.s. debt. holdings of treasury bills are included in the $1.17 trillion of total treasury securities owned by china as of november 2012.in addition to a national debt in excess of $16 trillion, the u.s. government in 2010 faced over $70 trillion in unfounded obligations, including social security and medicine benefits schedule to be paid retiring baby boomed retires in the coming decades, with unfounded obligations showing no sign of being reduced with congress at a deadlock over reducing federal government spending.you rico observed that if the u.s. dollar collapsed under the weight of proposed drama administration trillion-dollar budget deficit into the foreseeable future, holders of u.s. debt would face substantial losses that the financial times estimated   would devastated signs   hard-earned wealth and terminate economic globalization.    the basic idea is to turn asia savings, china  s in particular, into real business interests rather than let them be used to support u.s. over-consumption,   you rico wrote, reflecting themes commonly suggested by chinese government officials.   while fixed-income securities are vulnerable to any fall in the value of the dollar, equity claims on sound corporations and infrastructure projects are at less risk from a currency default,   he continued.the problem is that, in a struggling u.s. economy, china does not want to trade its investment in u.s. treasury debt securities, with their inherent risk of dollar evaluation, for equally risky investments in u.s. corporations and infrastructure projects.  but signs do not want to bear the risk of this investment because of market turbulence and a lack of knowledge of cultural, legal and regulatory issues in u.s. business,   he stressed.   however if a guarantee scheme were created, asia sabers could be willing to invest directly in capital-hungry u.s. industries.  you rico  s plan included four components:china would negotiate with the u.s. government to create a   crisis relief facility,   or cry. the cry   would be used alongside u.s. federal efforts to stability the banking system and to invest in capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as high-speed railroad from boston to washington, d.c.china would pool a portion of its holdings of treasury bonds under the cf umbrella to convert sovereign debt into equity. any cf funds that were designate for investment in u.s. corporations would still be owned and managed by u.s. equity holders, with the signs holding minority equity shares   that would, like preferred stock, be convertible.  the u.s. government would act as a guarantee,   providing a sovereign guarantee scheme to assure the investment principal of the cry against possible default of target companies or projects  .the federal reserve would set up a special account to supply the liquidity the cry would require to swap sovereign debt into industrial investment in the united states.  the cry would lessen signs   concern about implicit default of sovereign debts caused by a collapsing dollar,   you rico concluded.   it would cost little and help the u.s. by channing funds to business investment.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1776nation.comjerome r. dorsi, a harvard

1775,(renters) - rock star. novelty. myth-muster. surprise.that how some units describe ma love, a republican congressional nominee in utah who is spending stereotyped about the state and its predominant faith. a rising star and mayor of a small utah city, she will have a brief prime-time speaking role on tuesday at the republican convention.love, 36, is a black mormon in a deeply conservative state where her race makes up less than 3 percent of the population. if she best the popular, right-of-center democratic incumbent, jim matheson, in november, love would be the first black, conservative woman elected to the u.s. house of representatives, although polls show she faces an uphill battle.i believe our country is in big trouble, said love, also a runner who reaches fitness classes. if i can make a difference, not only should i do it, its my obligation as a parent and an american.in 2010, she was the first black woman elected as mayor of a utah city. sheds also a first-generation u.s. citizen whose parents migrated to new york from haiti in the 1970s in search of the american dream and who wanted to make sure their daughter contributed to society.love, a mother of three, says sheds running against six-term incumbent matheson in the newly created th district in central utah to do just that. matheson represents utah and district and often to run in the th after redistributing scattered his constituents.that love captured the republican nomination was a surprise both in and out of utah. a tea party darling, she is now seen as representing the strongest chance in a decade for republicans to push matheson, the lone democrat in utah congressional delegation and a fellow mormon, out of office.a wild card'little-known outside of saratoga springs, a farming hamlet turned city of 18,000 about 35 miles south of salt lake city, love leap-frogged over a crowded field including two better-known state lawmakers to sang the nomination with over 70 percent of the vote at the state republican convention in april.utah political insider chalked up her victory to a confluence of events, including fighting between two front-runners and an engaging speech by love that hit all the right notes for the traditionally conservative delegates.she champions limited government, fiscal discipline, personal responsibility and states rights. sheds pro-gun and holds a concealed weapon permit, opposed abortion and has said she would favor dismantling the federal departments of energy and education.she also supports utah effort to reclaim public lands from federal agency controls and would vote against regulations she believes would restrict economic development.she was clearly a wild card, matthew urban, a university of utah political science professor, said. sheds not all that different in the sense of her political views and her being a member of the majority religion. on the other hand, she does have a life story that is different than anybody i can think of in utah politics.love has the backing of the national republican congressional committee, which has given her campaign nearly $1 million for fall television as.i have never had a problem with people calling me a shiny new toy, but hopefully its what i stand for that matters, love said. i was elected as mayor with 60 percent of the vote, and it want because ism black and ism female.republican senator john main of arizona and house speaker john bother have campaigned for love in utah. former secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to appear at a utah event on september 7.ann money, wife of republican presidential contended mist money, has endorsed love, as has romney's running mate, paul ran. but national support, or even her speaking role at the republican convention, may not help love gain enough ground to win.a recent poll conducted for salt lake city media outlets the deseret news and is television found she trailed the race 53 percent to 38 percent.focus on racestill, there no question that loves race is part of what drawing the attention of party leaders, said lavra web, a longtime salt lake city-based republican strategist.they wouldn discuss this publicly, but the fact that a black woman could be elected in utah i think would signal that (the state) is more diverse and open-minded and cosmopolitan than people believe, web said.matheson, the son of utah last democratic governor, has held his seat because hers viewed as a moderate who breaks party lines to vote with republicans on issues that align with utah more conservative values, units said.matheson, however, disagreed that love offers voters anything dramatically different from past challenges.i dont think most utah want to get rid of the department of energy or the department of education, matheson said earlier this year at a community event. it just sounds like more of the same, extreme positions from someone who will go to washington and vote the party line.source: http://www.renters.com/article/2012/08/28/us-us-campaign-mormon-idusbre87q19q20120828
1776,hello,my nephew who is month now vomit excessively.it has been that way since birth.    he vomit daytime but mostly after eating. we have gone to the doctor and they say there is nothing wrong with him and diagnose him with herd.    we dont over feed him at all he eat small meal every two to three hours and we make sure he sits up for a least an hour after eating but he still vomit and he becomes very tired after a vomiting episode. i just found out last week that his uncle who is about 30+ and the uncle father has the same issue.    they have tried everything but they still vomit.is there any genito disorder this might be linked to?
1777,i am extremely topic (my doctor says i have pathological myoma in both eyes).    my left eye has a pretty bad macular hole and i also have severe attracts in the left eye (on the scale of 1 - 4, mine is a 3).    have been to two retina specialists, one who said that i should have the attract surgery first and then have the retina surgery to repair the hole, 2 weeks later.    the other said that she would do the retina surgery first.    i am reluctant to have the retina surgery at all, thinking that i might just live with the macular hole.    however, i was thinking that having the attract surgery might help improve my vision, even by just a little bit.    my attract surgeon told me it would be useless, the improvement being only so slight that i would hardly notice the difference.    he also said that because i am so severely topic, the attract surgery would increase the likelihood of future retina detachments and might even worse the macular hole or create some new retina problems.    why do attract surgery for such small returns?    he will only do the attract surgery if i agree to follow it up with retina surgery.    what do you think?this discussion is related macular hole repair success rate.

1788,good morning, ladies and gentlemen:well, here we are, with yet another week gone by.     are we having fun yet??at any rate, this is the day of the week that we do our weigh in, and discuss our success or set back.    ism happy to say that i am down 0.4 les this week -- wonder if its the same 0.4 les i lost a couple of weeks ago.......ll     seems that i lose and regain the same pounds over and over.    if i could keep off all the pounds have lost, i would probably be about right.oh well, a loss is a loss and ill take it. i did have a very busy week at work, so no time to get bored and convince myself that i was starving; also no time to stop at the convenience store to buy potato chips!!    in addition to that, being very busy, meant that i was physically active, so got exercise as well.    on thus, i had to load, transport and unload approve 40 cases of bottle water (24 - 16.9 oz bottles/case) so i even got in my weight training.thursday was the last of the greeting 10 he days have been working all summer; so beginning tomorrow will go back to regular 8 he days.    on toes, i see my endo and hope to get an increase in my thyreoid med; hoping between the shorter days and med increase, i will get back to feeling somewhat human again, which in turn will leave me with time and energy to get back on my exercise routine.okay, its your turn.    did you have success or set back?    if you were successful, did you do something different that worked better for you?    if so, please let us know - might be something we can all find useful.    if you had a set back, again, did you do something different, that might not have worked out for you?    please let us know what we can do to help get you back on track.there is no such thing as failure - only set backs.
1789,i am a 21 year old male. for the past two months i have been experiencing redness/inflammation on the head of my penis as well as the skin directly beneath the head. it is extremely sensitive all day and sore constantly, although worse at times. in the last year i have only had sexual contact with my long time partner and 2 other girls. when the symptoms began i was tested for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and bacterial infections, all clean. i was put on doxycycline for 10 days with no improvement. i then went and saw a urologist who put me on ciprofloxacin for 30 days, with no improvement. i went back to the same urologist and he prescribed mupirocin ointment for a week, no improvement. i went back to my original doctor who said it may be final and so told me to try lotrimin or monestat. i tried both with no improvement, then i was given 2 doses of diflucan which also did not help at all. i went and saw a dermatologist who told me it may be psoriasis and to try hydrocortisone ointment which has not helped either. i also have switched to hypoallergenic detergent and soap and all cotton underwear. i am beginning to seriously lose hope that anyone will be able to tell me what is wrong or how to fix it. the redness comes and goes, but it becomes very deep red and inflamed if i masturbate or have sex or even just have an erection. i have been told it is certainly not herpes by every single doctor due to it being constant for two months and there not being lesions but i am still fearful that this may be what it is. can anyone tell me if this could possibly be herpes? has anyone had similar problems or have any idea what the problem may be or how to fix it? any insight or advice would be extremely appreciated, this whole thing is a nightmare and i am praying i find a solution soon!

1798,one week ago, i began having slight discomfort in my testicle - upon inspection, i also noticed small, flat, red spots on the upper shaft of my penis.    the next day, the pain in my testicle was nearly unbearable, but the spots had faded.    i went to the doctor and he checked me over, gave me a re for micro and aorta, and sent me home, saying it was probably a general infection.    over the course of the week, the pain in my testicle would come and go, along with some nausea and an overall sick feeling.    i also noticed that the skin on the upper shaft of my penis seems to be peeling just a little bit.    now, a week later, i have some mild stinging with privation every once in a while, and again have small, red spots on my penis, along with the ever-present testicle pain - no discharge, ever, though.    i plan to return to the doctor tomorrow, but can someone please help me out with this?background:    married for a while and i and my wife have remained faithful.    wife shows no signs.

1802,this was sent to me from tea party..com     trust me they are back, the gun control issue    has brought them out of their holes     china posed to play debt card    for u.s. landcommunist nation could control american land as   development bones  (dr. jerome r. dorsi)    could real estate on american soil owned by china be set up as   development bones   in which the communist nation could establish chinese-owned business and bring in its citizens to the u.s. to work?that  s part of an revolving proposal being has been developing quietly since 2009 to convert more than $1 trillion of u.s debt it owns into equity.special: pass the lame stream media! expose the truth about   america  s fraud president   to unlimited households!under the plan, china would own u.s. business, u.s. infrastructure and u.s. high-value land, all with a u.s. government guarantee against loss.you rico, a professor of economics in the school of public policy and management at tsighua university in being, proposed in 2009 a plan for the u.s. government to guarantee foreign investments in the united states.and has reliable information that the bank of china, china  s central bank, has continued to advance the plan to convert china  s holdings of u.s. debt into equity owned by china in the u.s.the drama administration, under the plan, would grant a financial guarantee as an inducement for china to convert u.s. debt into chinese direct equity investment. china would take ownership of successful u.s. corporations, potentially profitable infrastructure projects and high-value u.s. real estate.the plan would be designed to induce china to resume lending to the u.s. on a nearly zero-interest basis.however, converting chinese debt to equity investments in the united states could easily add another $1 trillion to outstanding drama administration guarantees issued in the current economic crisis.as of november 2012, china owned $1.17 trillion in u.s. treasury securities, according to u.s. department of treasury and federal reserve board calculations published jan. 16.concerned about the unrestrained growth in u.s. debt under the drama administration, china has reduced by 97 percent its holdings in short-term u.s. treasury bills. china  s holding of $573.7 billion in august 2008, prior to the massive bank ballots and stimulus programs trigger by the collapse in the u.s. mortgage market, dwindled to $5.96 billion by march 2011.treasury bills are short-term debt that mature in one year or less, sold to finance u.s. debt. holdings of treasury bills are included in the $1.17 trillion of total treasury securities owned by china as of november 2012.in addition to a national debt in excess of $16 trillion, the u.s. government in 2010 faced over $70 trillion in unfounded obligations, including social security and medicine benefits schedule to be paid retiring baby boomed retires in the coming decades, with unfounded obligations showing no sign of being reduced with congress at a deadlock over reducing federal government spending.you rico observed that if the u.s. dollar collapsed under the weight of proposed drama administration trillion-dollar budget deficit into the foreseeable future, holders of u.s. debt would face substantial losses that the financial times estimated   would devastated signs   hard-earned wealth and terminate economic globalization.    the basic idea is to turn asia savings, china  s in particular, into real business interests rather than let them be used to support u.s. over-consumption,   you rico wrote, reflecting themes commonly suggested by chinese government officials.   while fixed-income securities are vulnerable to any fall in the value of the dollar, equity claims on sound corporations and infrastructure projects are at less risk from a currency default,   he continued.the problem is that, in a struggling u.s. economy, china does not want to trade its investment in u.s. treasury debt securities, with their inherent risk of dollar evaluation, for equally risky investments in u.s. corporations and infrastructure projects.  but signs do not want to bear the risk of this investment because of market turbulence and a lack of knowledge of cultural, legal and regulatory issues in u.s. business,   he stressed.   however if a guarantee scheme were created, asia sabers could be willing to invest directly in capital-hungry u.s. industries.  you rico  s plan included four components:china would negotiate with the u.s. government to create a   crisis relief facility,   or cry. the cry   would be used alongside u.s. federal efforts to stability the banking system and to invest in capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as high-speed railroad from boston to washington, d.c.china would pool a portion of its holdings of treasury bonds under the cf umbrella to convert sovereign debt into equity. any cf funds that were designate for investment in u.s. corporations would still be owned and managed by u.s. equity holders, with the signs holding minority equity shares   that would, like preferred stock, be convertible.  the u.s. government would act as a guarantee,   providing a sovereign guarantee scheme to assure the investment principal of the cry against possible default of target companies or projects  .the federal reserve would set up a special account to supply the liquidity the cry would require to swap sovereign debt into industrial investment in the united states.  the cry would lessen signs   concern about implicit default of sovereign debts caused by a collapsing dollar,   you rico concluded.   it would cost little and help the u.s. by channing funds to business investment.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1776nation.comjerome r. dorsi, a harvard

1819,i dont think i have dry socket but my pain is getting worse, its now the rd day after and the violin is no longer helping as the pain has worsted. my whole mouth hurts. the bottom wisdom teeth were already out but leaning towards my other teeth causing them to be slightly impacted i suppose but i didn need an oral surgeon apparently the dentist did the extraction. it took about an hour to do the one that was causing the pain and about 30 min to do the other one. the dentist was wonderful considering my lack of oral care hussar, i skipped work for a day and went back today, when i got home i was throbbing and it hasn stopped. should i go back to my dentist or do i need to just stuff it out. i dont want to be paranoid but i can eat and am crying most of the time
1820,ism 25yr old female and give been having low grade fever (37.5-c) for the last 5 months with no significant symptoms (except for very mild nasal congestion which might be alergic(allergic)). ism on epulis for epilepsy and i am not taking any other meditation. i dont feel sick at all, only a bit tired and chilly which is probably due to the fever itself. any ideas what it can be?when i was a small kid (3 years old) i had a fever for more than a year (38-c), i didn have any symptoms back then too. my parents took me to many doctors and i finally ended up in the hospital where they did many tests to find out what was going on (in tipsy included). they found nothing and concluded that i was healthy and in my case fever didn necessarily mean sickness. my parents say that my temperature got back to normal by the time i started primary school and it pretty much stayed normal with occasional break out- for example i could have been perfectly healthy but i would wake up in the middle of the night feeling feverish. sometimes i checked my temperature and it was c but by the time i woke up the next morning fever was gone and i was fine. however, those episodes got pretty rare after high school and now i canst even remember when i had the last one.i know that what medicine 22 years ago considered healthy might not be so today but maybe somebody here has some ideas or similar experiences? :d the low-grade fever that i am experiencing now is not making me feel sick, which is weird because sometimes when i have a cold and the same c i feel just awful and have no energy. i can study as usual and do all other things and most of the time i dont even feel that my temperature is higher than its supposed to be until i check.

1841,my girlfriend and i are planning a wedding and moving into a bigger apartment together. i am 30 and she is 20. i know she loves me! i dont know if its the stress of all that going on, but we dont have sex like we used to. lately we have been arguing more, but i just keep telling myself its just that we are both a little stressed. i dont know what to do??? i have to get on the internet and look at worn to release pressure myself, and she is fine with that. i know she loves me, but i dont know if she is still in love with me. this girl is my everything!!! i just want to feel like i am wanted sexually. we still kiss, muddle, i mean we do everything together, except have sex......please help me.....
1842,we have done all, tried all we knew and heard to do to get our 3 or old little boy to mind us and be a normal little boy. i know that this age can be trying i its self, but i am finding myself more regularly hoping someone in the family will take him for a couple days, or i just think to myself at times i just want to run away. i love our little boy with all my heart and i know he has it in him to be good, but the seems to be no end in sight to his very very mean and cruel behavior. he used to listen somewhat good before our second child was born almost months ago. now on a daily basis as soon as he wakes up it is literally not even 5 minutes later and i am already having to tell him repeatedly not to hit his brother, not to throw things, not to scream. i am 6 months pregnant with our third child and i am getting scared to think of what he might try to do to this sitting. i have tried everything from sitting down and talking to him, to time out, taking toys away, sending him to his room, and i have spanned him a couple times for the behavior but now more lately i feel like i am yelling at him all day long, waiting and praying for native and bedtime to get here soon because i feel like i am at my wits end with what i can do. he doesn even attempt to stop what he is doing unless i stand up, then he runs away but doesn stop. he tells me to shut up when i scold him for hitting the 18 month old or when i tell him not to play with the plug in and such. i dont know what else i can do. i read a post on here saying these actions could be an early sign of a mood disorder. mood disorders run deep and widely spread in my family. i have had therapist tell me i was bipolar and some that say i suffer from severe depression. could i have seriously given such a horrible trait to my child so early in life? are there more specific signs that i need to be watching for? i dont want my 3 or old to wind up having to be dedicated for the same thing i am at such an early age. i am also concerned about the behavior he has already taught my second child because he already beats his head on things when hers mad and he throws and hits whatever is closes when he is mad. please help me understand better of all of this. it is so distressful and i just want to enjoy my little guns while they are still so young, but i canst enjoy being stretched to my limits every single day, every hour and almost every minute he is awake. if he does wind up having some sort of mood disorder, how do they treat it in tollers and how safe is the medicine if needed? just asking because my little brother had add really bad when he was young and they gave him riding, however its spelled, i hated the way he was on that medicine. it was like he want fully there and i dont want that for my son.

1847,syria welcomes proposal to hand over control of chemical weapons(can) -- a new possibility for a diplomatic solution in syria surface unexpectedly monday as the war-torn country said it supported a proposal to hand over control of its chemical weapons.but a key question loomed: is that a viable option or simply a stall tactic as president lascar al-assad's government tries to state off u.s. military action?syrian foreign minister valid mallet told reporter in moscow that his nation welcomes a proposal by russian foreign minister sergey uvarov during talks on monday: put syrian chemical weapons under international control to avert a u.s. military response over an alleged poison gas attack last month.i declare that the syrian arab republic welcomes russians initiative, on the basis that the syrian leadership cares about the lives of our citizens and the security in our country, mallet said. we are also confident in the wisdom of the russian government, which is trying to prevent an american aggression against our people.the comments came after secretary of state john merry discussed a similar scenario, though the state department stressed later monday that syrian president lascar al-asked could not be trusted to relinquish his country chemical stockpiles.white house spokesman jay corner said the incredible threat of a u.s. military attack on syria led to the russian proposal, but he said any such plan would require close evaluation and that washington remained highly skeptically of the syrian regime.taking a hard look'still, the united states said it would take a hard look at the plan although state department deputy spokesman marie half said we canst have this be another stabling tactic.everything that asked has done over the past two years and before has been to refuse to put his them weapons under international control. he hasn declared them. weave repeatedly called on him to do so. and hers ignored prohibitions against them, she said.so i think its important to keep in mind the context under which this russian statement and this syrian statement is happening, that this is only happening in the context of a threat of u.s. military action, half added.latest developmentsearlier monday, merry said that al-asked could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.speaking at a news conference with british foreign secretary william hague, merry described that as an impossible scenario.he isn about to do it and it canst be done obviously, merry said.the state department later sought to clarify kerry's comment as a rhetoric argument and one u.s. official called it a major good, adding that americans top diplomat clearly went off script.there is no one in the administration who is taking this syria proposal seriously, the official said.after he flew back from london, merry spoke with uvarov, a senior administration official said. but it want clear whether the two officials had spoken before or after the russian foreign ministers meeting with his syrian counterpart.several state department representatives sought to clarify kerry's remarks later in the day.his point was that this brutal dictator (al-asked) with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons, otherwise he would have done so long ago, state department spokesman men sake said. that why the world faces this moment.axillary clinton weighs inward said taking a look at the russian proposal doesn mean the white house is backing down from its push to get authorization from congress to strike syria.in fact, the opposite. .... we think this is why its even more important that congress votes to authorize the president to use military action against syrian regime target, because we can be clear that if we dont give authorization to do so and we dont respond, then asked will see that as a green light to continue using these chemical weapons.could 'goof' be solution?but could kerry's possible gave be the key to a diplomatic solution?commentator andrew sullivan says he hopes so.we have the possibility of two things: that russia might actually act decisively to rein asked in, and also support the only viable policy to accomplish what drama wants -- protecting the world from these vile weapons, sullivan wrote monday. i have no idea whether this is a serious move by uvarov -- but it sure seems so, and it presents a fascinating non-binary option. it would manage to bring russia in to solving this problem, without its having to acquiesce to what put regards as american grand-standing. and it would surely have some traction at the un. sometimes, it seems, kerry's incompetence strikes gold. here hoping.the drama administration says the al-asked government was responsible for an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside damascus that it said killed more than 1,400 people.drama is seeking congressional approval for a military strike in response but is so far meeting resistance from lawmakers and the public concerned about the united states again intervening military in a foreign crisis.syria has been engulfed in a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people over the past two years, according to u.n. estimates.merry is due to participate in a classified bringing about syria to members of the house of representatives after his return from london later monday.u.n. chief: chemical weapons in syria would be 'abominable'http://www.can.com/2013/09/09/politics/syria-merry/index.html?hot=hp_t1

1860,hello folks. ism 22 years old. ism also a career firefighter. up until a few years ago, i slowly discovered i get caseous while doing physical work, mainly exercising. i have been on several fires since the start of my career and have threw up on 2 of them....(not good) both about 40 minutes into the call, just shortly after coming out of the building. i was doing extremely strenuous work in both of these fires, including reaching holes in walls to search for a victim, on top of fighting the actual fire.... i have been working out about every day since this issue. i found out when i exercise very hard that i feel a tightness in my throat (not my stomach) that makes me want to vomit. i realize part of it is my breathing, but i fixed that and still have the problem. i can control my adrenalin and i also dont think that is an issue. i am very fit, i weigh 150 les, and could run circles around most of my friends if the nausea didn hold me back. fortunately the nausea didn kick in until i was walking out the door of the building, but it hit me so fast and before you know it ism throwing up. to me, this is unacceptable for my occupation. ism willing to do anything, even if it means surgery to get this fixed. have noticed when i work out that its mainly when i do sit-up or am at some kind of angle...which unfortunately we as firefighters crawl on our hands and knees...my doctor doesn seem to know what up...so i am going to keep exercising more and more and hope this goes away but its not looking good even though ism getting more fit. can anyone please give me some advice?
1861,soar beyond your fears !!!once there was a king who received a gift of two magnificent falcon from arabia. they were peregrine falcon, the most beautiful birds he had ever seen. he gave the precious birds to his head falcon to be trained.months passed and one day the head falcon informed the king that though one of the falcon was flying majestically, soaring high in the sky, the other bird had not moved from its branch since the day it had arrived.the king summoned healers and orderers from all the land to tend to the falcon, but no one could make the bird fly. he presented the task to the member of his court, but the next day, the king saw through the palace window that the bird had still not moved from its perch. having tried everything else, the king thought to himself, may be i need someone more familiar with the countryside to understand the nature of this problem. so he cried out to his court, go and get a farmer.in the morning, the king was thrilled to see the falcon soaring high above the palace gardens. he said to his court, bring me the door of this miracle.the court quickly located the farmer, who came and stood before the king. the king asked him, how did you make the falcon fly?with his head bowed, the farmer said to the king,  it was very easy, your highness. i simply cut the branch where the bird was sitting.we are all made to fly -- to realize our incredible potential as human beings. but instead of doing that, we sit on our branches, clinging to the things that are familiar to us. the possibilities are endless, but for most of us, they remain discovered. we conform to the familiar, the comfortable, the mundane. so for the most part, our lives are mediocre instead of exciting, thrilling and fulfilling.so let us learn to destroy the branch of fear we cling to and free ourselves to the glory of flight.

1874,http://carlo.newsvine.com/news/2010/12/09/5619834-leaned-e-mail-fox-news-caught-slanting-news-reporting-at the height of the health care reform debate last fall, bill summon, fox news controversial washington managing editor, sent a meme directing his network journalists not to use the phrase public option.instead, summon wrote, foxes reporter should use government option and similar phrases -- wording that a top republican plaster had recommended in order to turn public opinion against the democrats reform efforts.journalists on the network flagship news program, special report with bet baker, appear to have followed summons directive in reporting on health care reform that evening.sources familiar with the situation in foxes washington bureau have told media matters that summon uses his position as managing editor to plant foxes supposedly neutral news coverage to the right. summons government option email is the clearest evidence yet that summon is aggressive pushing foxes reporting to the right -- in this case by issuing written orders to his staff.as far back as march 2009, fox personalities had sporadically referred to the government option.two months prior to summons 2009 meme, republican plaster frank aunt appeared on seen hannity's august 18 fox news program. aunt scolded vanity for referring to the public option and encouraged vanity to use government option instead.aunt argued that if you call it a public option,' the american people are split, but that if you call it the government option,' the public is overwhelmingly against it. aunt explained that the program would be sponsored by the government and falsely claimed that it would also be paid for by the government.you know what, vanity replied, its a great point, and from now on, ism going to call it the government option.[...]summon instructed staff to refer on air to government-run health insurance, the government option, the public option, which is the government-run plan, or -- when necessary -- the so-called public option:from: summon, billet: tuesday, october 27, 2009 8:23 auto: 054 -sunday; 169 -special report; 069 -politics; 030 -root (foxes.com); 036 -fox.who; 050 -senior producers; 051 -producerssubject: friendly reminder: lets not slip back into calling it the public option) please use the term government-run health insurance or, when gravity is a concern, government option, whenever possible.2) when it is necessary to use the term public option (which is, after all, firmly ensconced in the nations lesion), use the qualified so-called, as in the so-called public option.3) here another way to phrase it: the public option, which is the government-run plan.4) when newspapers and sources use the term public option in our stories, there not a lot we can do about it, since quotes are of course sacrosanct.
1875,i am having lens exchange surgery next week to remove hideous room lens and the surgeon originally said i would get a toxic as i have in my other eye now. today after more testing, i was told i would be getting a clear lens, not the toxic. he wasn  t around to ask but what is a   clear lens   exactly? just a lens with no strength? not sure i understand that and have seen nothing like that on this forum. they say i will see distance well but need reading glasses. i  m ok with that but any into on a   clear lens   and why it would be prescribed would help. my surgeon is out of boston and i trust him totally.

1878,to the doctor:    upon having the floating clouds in my vision for 1 week, i was diagnosed with vitreous detachment 2 days ago. the dr. said he usually sees the patient again after 3 weeks, but since i am schedule for a caribbean cruise in 9 days, he schedule me for a return visit in 1 week.    after thinking more clearly now, i am concerned about taking this cruise, in the event that something further happens to my eye while in the caribbean (for only a few days).    he didn tell me what stage the process is in or long this detachment process takes.    to obtain further clarification, i placed a call to him on fro. afternoon, but he never returned my call--today is sat. 11 a.m.    any suggestions on how to proceed? a friend is included in this trip, and i want to make a decision sap since the trip imparts others.
1879,now! where do i begin? ism 20+ and have had my mud in for nearly 2.5 months. before the mud was inserted i heard nothing but great things about the irene from all of my doctors. then, 8 weeks after i had my baby and the mud was inserted, i have heard nothing but gruesome horror stories about this device from others. but let me express to you my experience thus far.irregular periods & crampingsince insertion of the mud, i have only experienced light sporting. however, i have been experiencing some severe tramping off and on (approve. 1-2 times a day). literally, it feels as though someone is shoving a knife in my stomach. last week, i went in for a check to see if the device had been improperly placed. the ultrasound teach performed a trans-vaginal & regular ultrasound on me. according to my dr., the mud was properly placed & the results looked phenomena. but why didn i feel phenomena? as explained by my dr., severe tramping is a normal symptom and will probably occur for the next couple of months. i have yet to discover if this tramping will really and truly go away.weight:after birth, i weighed 232. before i had the irene inserted 8 weeks later, i weighed 207. since have had the irene, have lost 4 les and am still losing. also, i do not diet or exercise. however, i do believe the fact that i breasted may play a major role in my weight loss.sex drive:ha! not to be too detailed but i dont think i can get enough of my husband. ll!!!! before i got the mud, our sex life was great. afterwards, it was even greater. i will leave it at that!depression:ism pretty sure someone would become depressed after finding out that they have something inserted in them that could possibly cause them more harm than good. have found myself wrecking my brain over whether i should keep this thing in or take it out. have start thinking crazy thoughts like, what if i die and my baby is left motherless or what if i can never conceive again? does that not sound depressing? well, other than what have mentioned i do not think i am so depressed that i need antidepressants. ism just trying to understand if this thing is for me or against me. that all.hair loss:well, my hair always falls out when i comb it. but not so much to where it is noticeable. since this has been going on since before i got the irene, i do not think it has anything to do with it,overall:my experience with the irene has not been so bad as others. the only downfall for me is the severe tramping. i will update in a few months if things begin to go downhill for me.

1885,my son was at the age of 9 years diagnosed with undesending testis . this was never found at birth and now i am curious if this causes all the behavior problems and aggression he has had over the years .i am full of questions for the uroligist when i have to take him    on jan 24 2008.i knew when he was a toller something was not right with him having all the aggression he was exhibiting as a toller trying to sufforcate and hurt his sister . he was later diagnosed with short term memory problems in school and on a rep plan at school.he was diagnosed with add , old and optional defiant behavior as well .     i just dont understand why this was not caught at birth(undesending testicle) and even more so with regular well check up why the pedatrician never found this problem.    with his testis not being in his scrotum where they belong ..i took my son to a well check up with a pediatrican in sabastiani florida and she checked him out and found he has undecending testicle .. a major    shock for me and his father both ..ultrasound showed that on the left side less blood flow the cord getting tangled and on the right not as bad.when my son lived with his dad his step- mon took him to the doctor and my son was complaining of pain and he was tested for urinary infection but when this came back negative and our son continued to complain of pain the doctor never gathered to examine him father downstairs to see if the pain was coming another medical problem rather than a urinary infection was curious if this can cause problems with the male mormons and be the root of all his aggression or    he also has symptoms(symptoms)of prayer will .    he will drink soda to the point of making himself sick . he has had an obssesion with the refrigerator since he was a toller ... his mi is at the 95% and i could be wrong but he does have many of the symptoms(symptoms)... not sure if he would have this with the xx problem ?    i m not a doctor but i thought if his testicle were not were they should be he would have low mormons not high .. but could either cause all the behavior problems ..thanks

1898,hello- i am 36 yes old.    i had vols put in in 97.    i have always had small halls ever since.    seems in the past 5 years the halo effect is getting worse in both eyes but more in the right.    when my right eye tries to focus on the sun, or a certain light, it has a disco-ball type effect around the light until my eye focused as best it can.    if i look the other direction into the same light, the disco effect is still present, only it is counter-clockwise in the same direction of the eye. kind of streaks.        similar to what flowers do when you attempt to catch them in your visual field.    the amber street lights at night are horrible in the right eye.    the symptoms best described are as if i am looking through a defective peace of plastic.    reminds me of what plastic headlights on cars do after several years.    they break down or something.    has anyone out there ever heard of something like what i describe about    my ill?    i have been to many doctors and eyes check out fine, vols look clear.    is it possible that what i am seeing, the doctors may not be able to see with their equipment?    ism trying my hardest to make it, and this is a big problem every day while working.    please let me know if anyone has heard of a similar situation.    thanks.....

begin at about 5 p.m. eastern time.i hope that family members, before the day is over, start to hug their fathers, brothers, sons, he said.follow breakingnews.com for the latest updatespinera told the mother of 31-year-old florence valor that hell be the first of 33 men to be rescued from the collapsed mine.his mother, maria sila, says hers not surprised he was chosen and that sheds very proud of him. valor is a married father of two children and one of the mining crew bosses..we made a promise to never surrender, and we kept it, intra said, shortly before two rescue workers were expected to go down to prepare the miners for their trip. the president said the first miner will be brought up about two hours later.chile has taken extensive precautions to ensure the miners health and privacy, sending down navy special forces paramedics to prepare them for the trip and using a screen to block the top of the shaft from more than 1,000 journalists at the scene.nervous anticipation grew among the miners relatives and friends as mining minister lawrence holborn earlier said rescue aimed to start pointing the miners in a custom-made escape capsule on tuesday evening, hours ahead of schedule.panic attacks feared during miner rescue..the men have spent 69 days in the hot, humid bowels of a gold and copper mine in chiefs northern alabama desert after an aug. 5 collapse, and now face a harrowingly claustrophobic journey to the surface in specially-made capsules.asked about the biggest technical problem that could hit the rescue operation, coordinate andre sougarett said: a rock could fall.there is no need to try to start guessing what could go wrong. we have done that job, a confident holborn said. we have hundreds of different contingencies.rescue were keeping the miners busy on final preparations they were to climb into the capsule for what tests indicated should be a smooth ride to the outside world.the rescue of all the miners is expected to take about 48 hours, bc news reported, with crews working around the clock. it will take approximately one hour for each miner to reach the surface    a few minutes to situate a miner in the capsule, 10-15 minutes travel time upward, and then 25-30 minutes to drop the escape cage down the shaft again.as the miners emerge, they will be sheltered from the glare of to camera. they will get an immediate medical check and gather with a few family members in an area closed to the news media. officials say a sire will sound as each miner emerges.then, they will ride in helicopter    two at a time if they are in beds, or four at a time if they can sit up    to the regional hospital in copiapo for a battery of physical and psychological exam.our job is to provide benefit and not harm, manalich said, urging the media    more than 1,000 journalists are working on the story    to respect their privacy. we have to protect them until the last minute, until they can return to normal lives with their families.wives, children, parents and friends are waiting on an arid, rocky hillside around 2,050 feet directly above them at a tent settlement dubbed camp hope and ready to celebrate..right now ism calm, though still very anxious. i hope my nerves dont betray me when the rescue starts, said jessica salad, whose husband flex is wrapped below.president piniera, who ordered a reap of mine safety regulations in the wake of the accident, arrived at the mine on tuesday afternoon in anticipation of the rescue. one of the miners is a bolivia national and bolivia president eve morals has also vowed to visit the mine for his rescue.camp hope'while the men endured their darkened days below, life at camp hope has turned into a spanning ground of intrigue, envy and rivalries that have divided the miners relatives holding vigil here    just as their shared plight unites them.after 69 days of shared fears and matters    all of it under the close scrutiny of dozens of reporter that have now grown to a battalion    the early fellowship has frayed. some relationships, once at least cordial, are as hostile as the desolate sands of the surrounding alabama desert.here the tension is higher than down below. down there they are calm, said verona icon, sister of 29-year-old are icon, a wrapped ruble-removal machine operator...relatives privately shared stories of the divisiveness with an associated press reporter who spent the past month at the camp, frequently bedding down in a tent beside theirs, sharing coffee and gossip.the ends and jealousies within families centered on such matters as who got to take part in weekend videoconferences with the miners, who received letters and why    or even who should speak to the media and how much they should be revealing about a family interior life.

1902,i had ten crowns done at the same time four days ago.    scott tried to answer my question, but he assumed that i still have temporary crowns.    the severe pressure has diminished somewhat but i now feel pain in two of the teeth; it seems that the nerves have been compromised by the pressure and now with relief of the pressure i feel pain through the teeth.    i also believe that the two crowns may not be sealed because a slight odor seems to be emitting from those two teeth.    ism going to the dentist on 4-14-09 at am.    please advise on how to handle this with the dentist.    read my previous post    for the entire story.thanks,sick
1903,i am of-1 and weigh 172 pounds and i am a highly competitive runner and sordid skies.    for the past two years, when i run, or train at a high level of intensity (in. intervals or racing) the blood pressure in my right leg drops dramatically, thus causing a tremendous pain/burn in my quadriceps (upper and lower), and calf - it feels like a 40 pound weight has been attached to my leg, ultimately forcing me to stop.    when i do stop, it takes a minute for my leg to return to normal.    the doctors have consulted call this sensation claudication, but have yet to find out what is causing the disorder.    i have gone to message therapy, worked on various stretches, and gone through several batteries of tests (treadmill/stress, angiogram, mr/mr, monogram), yet to no avail.    speculation ranges from chronic compartment syndrome of the upper leg, which i have found very little information, to overdeveloped adductor or quadriceps muscles, to even the possibility that my femoral or iliac arteries are being banded by my muscles across the inguinal ligament - no one knows!    i have reached the point of maximum frustration and i do not know what to do do next - can you help me?    have you ever heard of this problem?    how do i fix it without stopping?
1904,give had clot of eye problems ever since i first started wearing contact.. give had ulcers, tons of pink eye, and even a cut or two on my eyes. but my doctor always took care of them well before he retired, and when it happened it was always few and far between. a while back after my eye doctor retired my right eye lids had started swelling. i thought oh no bigger its spring i get galleries and sinus probe etc... but it never stopped swelling.. after about a 4 weeks my eye was swollen so big and it had become so red it look like i had been punched in the eye socket without getting bruised. so typically i go to the emergency room thinking this is way different than the normal pink eye or ulcers.. and it want even painful which was my other concern.after like a nice 5 hour wait in told i have pink eye. they didn swab my eye, do tests or anything.. they only made me read a board across the room without my glasses on. well i was very ensure of the answer they gave me but went home took the beds they gave me and nothing worked. after about 4 months the swelling stopped. my eye went back to normal, and i was able to wear contact again. so i get a new doctor, new prescription.. turns out that eye sees even better than my last check 2 years ago.well now it has started swelling again.. and in pretty sure its not because i dont are care of my eyes.. because after a painful ulcer like the ones give had i am extra extra careful with my contact. so now on top of swelling its producing a ton of protein build in my eyelids and on my eyelashes especially when i wake up.. i can even open my eye some days because its sealed shut. what am i going to do? i know this can be pink eye.. there no way it could last this long and not at least effect the other eye or be somewhat painful. i need some advice.. anyone have any earthly ideas what it could possibly be?

1907,by: j. christian adamsoped contributoraugust 9, 2010two unpleasant topics of conversation most of us avoid are the epidemic of his/aids among prison inmates and a variety of sometimes violent events resulting in transmission of the disease. some states long ago implements policies to protect the infected part of the prison population while providing exceptional medical treatment and counselling to the infected population.in south carolina, it has worked so well since 1998 that there has only been a single transmission of his/aids to a noninfected prisoner. all that may change, however, thanks to a threat from eric holders justice department.south carolina received a letter from the now-infamous civil rights division that the policy of keeping infected inmates at a designate facility, instead of scattered across the state in the general prison population, may unfairly stigmatize infected prisoners. to the drama political appointees in the civil rights division, this constitutes discrimination under the americans with disabilities act.the justice department objects to separate living facilities and specialized medical treatment for the his/aids prison population. naturally, do has threatened a lawsuit.apparently the justice department doesn have the will or resources to follow through in cases against new black another party thus brandishing weapons at polling places, but has no difficulty shaking down a state with an effective and humane policy toward prisoners.these folks are shameless, says john omit, the no-nonsense director of the south carolina prison system, referring to the civil rights division at do. he told me that every single new prisoner is tested for aids upon incarceration.omit says half of those testing positive never knew they were infected. the testing policy saves lives because treatment starts immediately, at state expense.those testing positive receive treatment at the broad river road correction facility near columbia. they also receive extensive counselling there. but they are not part of the general prison population.south carolina doesn have to do this. for states, the state doesn have to test prisoners. it could simply toss infected inmates unwittingly into the general prison population.these inmates would be scattered across 28 facilities, all without the specialized care available at the broad river facility. all of the extra counselling and treatment is also optional, but provided by the state at significant expense.south carolina spends more than $2 million a year helping infected inmates in the very program the do is challenging. we couldn ever hire specialists at all of the facilities spread across the state like we can in the single columbia facility, omit told me.the do is in a lose-lose situation. even if do wins a lawsuit, sources tell me south carolina is simply going to cancel all of the special testing, treatment and counselling, thereby saving the state $2 million a year.instead, the state will dump infected prisoners into the general population, and nobody will know they have aids. worse, prisoners who come to prison with his/aids will never know they have the disease and their lives will be shortened because the testing program will end.special counselling would end, too. of course, if do loses a lawsuit, which seems likely, they lose.our policy promotes health and safety. testing all inmates and treating his/aids is expensive and many states do not test, omit says. they have identified which inmates can impose a death sentence by biting, stabbing or merely conflicting a flesh wound with a contaminated weapon and we have eliminated the spread of his/aids to other inmates or to staff.justice raises three primary objections to this effective and humane approach. first, it prevents infected prisoners from participating in activities and jobs of their choosing. leave it to bureaucratic in washington to contact the grievance that prisoners have choice when it comes to activities in the first place.second, do claims the south carolina program is unconstitutional, something the courts have repeatedly rejected. once again we see the rule of law falling by the wayside when it comes to decisions of this civil rights division. this is the same civil rights division that was sanctioned more than $4 million during the clinton administration for bringing cases as frivolous as the one against south carolina prisons.third, with all the traumatism of a sociology lecture at harvard, do argues that the separation of the his/aids prisoners stigmatizes the prisoners. omit responds, prison is a voluntary activity; breaking the law, earning a criminal record, and wearing state issue,' all stigmatize. since one purpose of prison is punishment, this stigmatization is somewhat intentional. how refreshing.ozmint's comments reveal the accelerating divide between highly paid bureaucratic in washington and people in the rest of the country. having worked in the civil rights division, i cannot emphasize strongly enough how perfectly correct and completely justified do bureaucratic consider policies like the threat to south carolina to be. and having lived and worked in the private sector and in parts of america far from the betray, i also cannot overtake just how insane such policies sound to most americans.it isn just the south carolina prisons in the crosshairs of the civil rights division. it is mortgage lenders and insurance companies. it is movie theaters and flat-broke counties that dont print ballots in foreign languages.its also amazon.com, which tried to sell a talking kindle reader, but justice said it couldn because the button to make the kindle talk didn have bridle. never mind that books neither talk nor have bridle buttons telling them to talk.the business community would be wise to wake up and recognize the immense power the civil rights division exerts over the private sector. groups like the u.s. chamber of commerce should devote resources to understanding and moderating the extremist tendencies of the current civil rights division. even returning to clinton-era policies would be an improvement.keep in mind that the clinton justice department refused to attack the south carolina prison plan even though it was pressed to do so. there is now a different species of democrat in power in washington.even south carolina democrats have disclaimed their party brethren in washington over the do threat. this is the last thing incumbent democrat john sprang needs in his contest against sick mulvaney in the rural th congressional district -- more proof the administration in washington has gone bankers.this is about whether you want more aids or less aids in the prisons, omit said. all indications are that the south carolina department of corrections isn going to surrender an inch to the do.officials promise to do whatever it takes to defeat a lawsuit. no case brought by the civil rights division is bulletproof. many defendant incorrectly think they can never defeat the department in litigation, so they capitulate and settle.as south carolina may soon demonstrate to the rest of the nation, it pays to fight back.j. christian adams served as an attorney in the civil rights division and covers election law at electionlawcenter.com.find this article at:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/justice-department-fights-south-carolina-over-efforts-against-aids-in-prisons-1008381-100224289.html#ixzz0w7ylzgpf
1908,my retina specialist has consistently said i have mild dry army.    in june, 07, my visual field in the army and glaucoma eye was near normal.    two weeks ago, i had another visual field taken and was told the eye has worsted significantly.    the glaucoma specialist says its probably the retina, based on her interpretation of the visual field data.i am seeing much worse in that eye, with a grating of the central vision.    i also have severe flowers which have been increasing over the last six months.    each time checked, have been told no tears.    flowers may have fooled me that there was no change in the central vision due to retina changes.are such rapid changes in visual field unusual?is it possible for any other factor to be the main contributory to my dramatic vision change/loss in the left eye, other than worsening macular conditions?
1909,my 5 year old son was playing with the hamper that is full of dirt(dried leaves,etc). suddenly he got up and holding his right eye. after few minutes, he said he was fine. but then after few hours i noticed a blackish,brownish,reddish little spot on the white of his eye under the lower eyelid. he said there is no pain, and it does not bother him. is it possible that the spot is an embedded dirt or could it be a haemorrhage? he was also coughing too much on that day it happened.thank you for any response to my problem

1916,washington (can) - after months of intense negotiations, a partisan u.s. house group has reached an agreement in principle on immigration reform, according to rep. marie diaz-apart of florida, one of the go members of the group.a democratic aide familiar with the discussions confirmed that all the members signed on and told can both democrats and republicans will now run the whole package past their respective leadership and colleagues and aim to formally introduce legislation at the beginning of june.diaz-apart declined to get into the details of the deal, but said, there going to be a lot of differences in a lot of areas, from a partisan measure working its way through the senate.filing a real partisan bill    a serious, enforceable commonsense bill is, i think, a huge step. but its the first step of the process    a very important step, diaz-apart told reporter outside the house floor thursday.the four republican members of the house group include diaz-apart, rep. paul labrador of idaho, and rep. john carter and rep. sam johnson, both of texas.the four democrats are rep. easier becerra and toe lofgren, both of california, rep. louis gutierrez of illinois, and rep. john warmth of kentucky.carter told reporter earlier on thursday that the last sticking point involved whether the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states would get access to government health care benefits. its unclear how the group resolved that issue.carter also said that because republican and democratic negotiator were unable to come to an agreement on a program overseen guest workers, the group decided to leave that issue out of the bill. but both planned to offer their proposals separately, likely as amendments to the main legislation.both sides differed on how many worker vistas should be allowed for construction companies and other industries relying on low skilled labor workers.house speaker john bother pledged that any immigration bill would move through the appropriate committees in the house before any vote by the full chamber.a key test for the partisan deal will come when the house judiciary committee takes it up, because that panel includes a significant number of conservatives, who have pledged to block any measure that allows a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.bother signalled he wanted the house to have its own version to negotiate a final immigration bill with the democratic-led senate.i continue to believe that the house needs to deal with this and the house needs to work its will, bother said on thursday.the senate plan is now being considered by the judiciary committee.source: http://politicalticker.blows.can.com/2013/05/16/breaking-house-reaches-immigration-agreement/?hot=hp_t2
1917,http://lifting.today.com/news/2013/04/23/17880268-rich-got-richer-during-the-recovery-and-rest-got-poorer-study-says?little nation  s richest american households generally gained wealth during the first two years of the economic recovery, a new research report finds, while most american households saw their net worth drop.the report, released tuesday by the pew research center, found that the mean net worth for the 7 percent of american households at the top of the wealth distribution rose by 28 percent between 2009 and 2011, the most recent data available.meanwhile, the mean net worth for the other 93 percent of american households fell by 4 percent during that period, according to pew  s analysis of census data.overall, the aggregate net worth for all american households rose between 2009 and 2011. but pew  s more detailed analysis showed that the gains were concentrated among the wealthiest americans, and the wealth gap increased during that time.economists say that  s a continuation of a trend toward more wealth being found at the top of the income scale.  there  s been a growing concentration of wealth in this country for quite a while now, and it  s just really accelerated in the last, really, 15 years,   said joel tariff, chief economist with tariff economic advisers, who was not involved in the pew study.the great recession officially ran from december of 2007 to june of 2009, but the recovery since that time has been weak and uneven.the pew researches said allies in stocks and bonds, which benefited affluent households with major investments, largely drove the discrepancy in wealth gains during those two years.the housing market, where many other americans derive a lot of their wealth, did not do that well during that period.the pew researches said they focused on the top 7 percent of the wealth distribution because that was the lobulation available from the census data. the report found that the mean net wealth for those 8 million households rose to around $3.17 million in 2011, from approximately $2.48 million in 2009.for the other approximately 111 million households, mean net worth fell to nearly $134,000 in 2011, from nearly $140,000 in 2009.the report  s authors note that some less-wealthy american households no doubt saw wealth gains during the period. in general, however, more of the households in that 93 percent saw their wealth fall rather than rise.tariff noted that income distribution is always shifting in one way or another, but the wealth gap has grown especially wide in recent years. that could pose problems for an economy that is largely driven by consumer spending.  we haven  t seen it at least in 100 years as heavily distributed to the upper income side as we  re seeing now, and we don  t know whether that pattern is readily reversed,   he said.   and if it  s not reversed what happens to the economy that  s built on a consumer base? that  s the uncertainty that we have.  i was going to add this onto ms. pus banking thread but i thought it deserved its own.

1924,hi guns. ism asking this question on behalf of my dad. he has developed attracts in both eyes and is looking into the surgery option.the local surgeon has presented him standard monofocal vols and the acrysof restore ill. the surgeon has recommended the monofocal. i have looked around the web and found that there are other option in the multifocal department such as the am room and the am tennis multifocal. i will look around for the availability of these lenses.my dad does some driving and also uses the computer. from what i have read the room seems like a better choice since it balances out between near and far vision. i could not find information about the tennis, though according to the webster it provides all round excellent vision for all distances.i have two questions. first, would a multifocal be far superior to the monofocal? i ask because the multifocal lens is quite a bit more expensive. second, i have read that the restore lens has now been improved. if so, what are the advantages/disadvantages between the restore, room and tennis? user reports would be really useful.thanks in advance for all the help.

1940,i posted a rather lengthy explanation of my history on april with and was answered by dr. michael kutryb who suggested my seeing the best opthamologist in my area.    i have an appointment with an opthamologist later this month, but may cancel in order to try to see another who is probably one of the best in st louis.    this doctor was recommended by a neurologist whom i saw today.    he diagnosed me with oh, vot koyanagi hard syndrome or disease, after a very brief consultation.    i am not sure that he even looked at my medical history.    i was somewhat in shock and was confused with this diagnosis, especially since    he came up with it so quickly.    after looking it up online, i am even more confused since i do not have the skin and hair symptoms.    he assured me that he is a very good doctor and knows what he is talking about and was very convincing. either that is true or he is psychic or a miracle worker!    i will take a miracle at this point. my question is related to the fact that he said that it is not a neurological problem.    what i have read seems to indicate that there can be neurological aspects or complications.    i have worried that the chronic inflammation that i have been experiencing for so long may be causing some kind of nerve damage.    i have both visual and mental disorientation. i have not driven a car for almost two years.    the opthamologist that i have been seeing for the past few years has never mentioned uveitis.    do i dare to hope that i may be finally getting some answers?this discussion is related could my eyes have been contaminated?.
1941,i just recently moved in with my girlfriend who daughter is 5 (i have no kiss) - the little girl is basically running things around the house and mon gives in to everything the girl wants, eventually. give talked to my of about it and weave come to the conclusion that something must be done. every morning there is a fight about brushing teeth, and what clothes she will and wont wear (she tells mon to pick it out, then says no she not wearing it, pick out something else and so on and so forth), do my hair like yours, no that not good enough..etc. -    but at night is the biggest problem, mon has allowed, thus far, the little girl to lay on the couch every night and watch to until she falls asleep, then mon carries her to her room and puts her down, every night the little girl wakes up and crawl in bed with us (she seems too old, to me at least, for this behavior). i sat the little girl down and talked to her, told her we were setting some new rules and have set up a shores and reward program and also given her some big kid responsibility to make her own breakfast and pick out her own clothes. the girl responds to me quite well and does what i ask of her except when mon gets around, but that another issue altogether. so big new rule was we were going to act like a big girl and sleep in her own bed, no to - instead reading a book, and if she woke up in the middle of the night, at first, she could come in the room with us (just to when her off of it slowly) but at least start off in her room. it started off wonderfully, mon read her a story then i laid in there and talked to her until she fell asleep - then 1:am wake up call... horrible.. she throws a huge fit, blood curling screams and nonstop crying,    because she wants to watch to, we say no and stick to it (but of course mon wants us to just turn on the to to shut her up).. the fit lasts about min, then she wants an orel, then she wants her daddy, then back to the to, this fit, still screaming and crying and now running from us around the house and trying to turn on the to set, lasts another 30 min.. then when finally realizing she is not getting her way, a new game begins, now her eyes hurt and she can sleep and now she needs medicine cause her leg hurts and now she needs a damp rag for her eyes, no not that towel a different towel, now you didn wet it enough, now she thirsty, now she doesn want the towel, now she does want the towel, get a different towel, now she wants to sleep in moss bed. i wanted to put her in her room and let her cry it out, but in apparently heartless, mon gives in to the new game being played now.. no longer the to fight, its now the power struggle to get her way (at least in my eyes), and the kid just won it again.. please help me before mon loses faith in my ideas for better behavior (it was hard enough to even talk to her about it seeing as its not my kid) and before i go insane.

1949,i have a 3 year old son who throws the worst temper antrum. up until he turned 3 we always seemed to give into him but now that we are a month off having our third child (we also have a 6 year old girl) he is uncontrollable. he doesn listen, never does what he is told and his antrum are leaving my husband and i at our wits end. one minute he can be so good and adorable and then he changes like you have flicked a switch and goes crazy. i am so worried that there may be an underlying condition.
1950,it has been a long time since i have learned that i suffer from severe depression, that one paralytic disaster can spin me wildly off the straight mind set. it happened and still to this day i keep suffering that consequence. i keep feeling like i spin deeper down a pit of a never ending reminder of broken hearts, torn souls and never ending tears. the reply in my mind of everything just never stops and it has slowly been killing me inside. i have wished for death so many times knowing it would stop this pain that i can  t control. you see i never was the person who would drink her sorrows away or drug myself up. i am the person who would conflict pain to rid myself of other pains. sadly, admitting a second form of pain isn  t working anymore and i feel the further i allow this pain to control me the darker my mind set is getting. i don  t want to leave, i feel like i need to accomplish something with my life, anything to prove to myself that it is worth living. how does anyone handle this? there really isn  t anyone i trust enough to talk to about it; unemployment doesn  t give me much to afford therapy or even meditation. it  s becoming firing to put on a happy face for others when i am not happy.
1951,my close up or reading vision has not been very good for some time ( years-) in in the past 2 years    reading glasses and magnifyers had enabled me to do some craft work for short periods of time. i have had a multitude of procedures over the past few years and have become accustomed to and adjusting to low vision.    in any case i have had more retinaplexi for horse tears in the retina ( 3 ) this year and the specialist explained that the vitreous is pulling away and occasionally causes these tears. i think the do is getting a bit more concerned lately ( although he tells us its ok ) because he has me on a    2 - 3 month exam schedule now ( went from yearly to 9 to 6 and now every 2-3 months )my question is this-- lately my reading vision is worse- not a lot but noticeably worse- my distance vision seems to be the same.     i think the do told us one time that the macular ( had some bouts with macular swelling and a pucker feel-vitrectomy in the right eye ) effects close up or detail vision but we think he said the vitreous pulling away also effects close up vision in older patients ( i am only 54 but the do told us one time that my eyes remind him of much older in terms of conditions ) .before my macular pucker and vitrectomy    ( it eye )    that eye was of no help to read act. and was making me sick from all the waved    images and the procedure has taken care of that 100% and i can almost read the top line of the reading chart with it now .does the vitreous pulling away effect reading vision??i am constantly getting round dot flowers in my left eye and do said eventually we may have to do a vitrectomy on the left eye but doesn want to until absolutely needed- i asked if it was because of possible side effects and he said no he just feels it would be better to wait---i do have lens issues ( ocular rosacea-dry eye-chronic conjunctivitis ) all that flare up and lower reading i know it can come from them but i am treating all those and they have their up and down it just seems like the vaseline reading vision is consistently a bit worse and we are trying to decide about calling do or waiting until june 4 appointment if no further or increased problems . it pretty much sounded to my wife and i that my reading vision would always be a struggle and the low vision aids    are about all i can do right now.i have so many small issues that it becomes a bigger issue overall is how one do explained it .does a vitrectomy slow down or stop vitreous pulling away ??why would they want to wait if it doesn cause side effects??my it eye isn real helpful to read but since the feel-vitrectomy- i have had no round dots and haven noticed any flowers since ( 1 1/2 years )thanks realize there are so many issues here-perhaps if nothing else you could refresh us on why my reading close up vision gets worse with age- the do explained    but with all the other stuff we are mixed up .

1953,my eyes were always perfect. about 5 months ago, after work my eyes suddenly went blurred, i could not focus clearly on anything further than 3 feet away from me. it was as if it would only come in to focus when i came within a certain distance from the object. i saw numerous opticians, doctors and opthamologists and had mixed reports. the optical prescribed me glasses but couldn explain the sudden slurring of vision. doctors could not explain it either and said that if the glasses helped then i should wear them. then i saw an opthamologist who said my eyes were perfect and that i should never have been prescribed glasses in the first place! at that stage i got a it scan down and everything was clear, i also had blood tests done and nothing came back unusual. it is now months after and my eyes are still blurred, especially if i am tired. i have also had a constant headache for the past 3 weeks that i can seem to shake. what do you think is wrong with me?
1954,if masturbation doesn hurt you then why are you getting thin day by day while doing it?this discussion is related side effects of masturbation.
1955,sounds like this past week was a little distressful and trying on most of us.    lets try making three positive affirmation of things we will do this week to turn it around!remember .. our brain believes what we tell it!    so, if we tell it were going to succeed we will .. if we keep thinking of failure, it becomes a higher possibility.ready .. set ... go ... three positive affirmation!!!!    yes .. we can do this!
1956,i realized that on bright lights or on object with a light or shining on it i see it almost double vision but not fully. example on car lights i see the light extended.could this be a medical problem?also does double vision mean you need glasses or is that mean something is wrong with a person health?
1957,as have started to answer questions here at medhelp.org, ism flabbergasted about the number of readers that are looking for hug injections for weight loss.hug injections do not cause weight loss. ism sorry to burst all your bubbles, but it just doesn.for dozens of years these have been specifically not allowed by the da for treatment of obesity and weight loss. i recall that its sometimes prescribed as part of fertility treatments and if, though. here the link to da guidance about those wanting to advertise about hug injections da requires all laboring and advertising of hug to state that it has not been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of obesity. the as must also state that hug is not approved by da as safe and effective in treatment of obesity of weight control.him..odd...
1958,my son is 1 year and 4 months. he has arthritis. it has affected his left knee and toe. he is being treated by a pediatric rheumatologist in parisian who has also worked in australia. he gets injected with methotrexate weekly. his blood tests are repeated every 3 weeks. his ear has reduced from 80 to 17. his haemoglobin had been affected a little but with iron supplement it is fine now. we also give him colic acid.now i am only concerned with his sept(at) level. it was normal for a long time.his injections started with 0.1 c for one month, 0.2 c for 3 weeks, 0.3 c for 3 weeks and 0.4 c for another 3 weeks.his sept was 15, 15, 20, 30 and after the last test it was 82    i.u/l.let me tell you that just ten days before this test he had 2 antibiotics for his infected tonsils.could that have elevated his sept? is this level dangerous? what other tests should be performed to check for any problems or should we wait and get it tested a few weeks later?thankyou,roman.
1959,my sons sight was just tested and he has 20/30 vision.    its not perfect but its not bad either.    the optometrist said he can probably see fine but if he sits far from the board at school, he may have difficulty reading it.    my son plays little league and will be playing basketball in the fall.    i wanted to get some advise on whether i should get him prescription glasses.    should i wait until he is complaining that he is having difficulty seeing things or get a mild prescription for him now.    i dont think it affects his sports but who knows if hell do better if he has clearer vision.    please advise.    thanks!
1960,editors note: paul rieckhoff is an ran veteran, the founder and executive director of ran and afghanistan veterans of america (cava) and the author of chasing ghosts. follow him on twitter @paulrieckhoff.(can) -- imagine you served for one year with the u.s. army in ran. imagine you served an additional tour in afghanistan a year later.and imagine being injured in that last tour after a roadside bomb exploded from beneath a trashcan as your humble rolled by. your muddy sitting next to you was killed. after you left the army and returned home, you had trouble rousing. you had headache and issues with your vision. you realize you returned with what might be a traumatic brain injury. and maybe post-traumatic stress disorder, too.imagine you also have two kiss younger than 7 who haven seen you very much for the last half decade. imagine your struggling to find a job. you've got a lot on your plate. and your understandable stressed.you dont want to let down your family. and you dont want to be viewed as weak or a limp by your bodies.you summon the courage to overcome the stroma, and you go to your local department of veterans affairs to get some help. you file a claim for disability benefits to get the care and compensation you've earned and the support you need to keep your family afloat financially. your hopeful.now imagine waiting 600 days before you get an answer from the department of veterans affairs. 600 days.600 days of staring at your mailbox. 600 days of phone calls to check in. 600 days of bills piling up. 600 days of disappointment.sounds crazy, right? well, for thousands of veterans nationwide, its real life.if you are a young met who filed a claim with the department of veterans affairs in new york or los angeles, you will wait an average of 600 days. and your not alone.more than 900,000 veterans of all generations are stuck in a bureaucratic loam that, in 2013, is the almost too absurd to believe. after 10 years of war, three va secretaries, and an increase in the overall department budget of 40% since 2009, an incredible 97% of veterans claims are still on paper.yep, paper.america has soldiers in nevada rioting drones remote that can strike a target thousands of miles and two continents away, but 97% of our veterans benefits claims are still on paper.earlier this month, the center for investigation reporting released a leaned internal va document that showed the entire world what veterans nationwide have known for years: the va backing problem is even worse than reported.the va has reported that the average claim wait time was 273 days. for the first claim filed, its longer: 316 to 327 days. in los angeles, that figure is 619. in new york, its 642. in indianapolis, its 612 days. and gets with first-time claims in rent, nevada, wait 681 days.the va has testified that it has hired 3,300 new claims processors, but it has failed to report that, because of staff turnover, the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010. and, in chicago; was, texas; and oakland, california, the overall number of claims processors has gone down.since the internal documents were leaned last week, weave yet to see a public response from va secretary eric shinseki or from the commander in chief.some 2.6 million men and woman answered the call to serve in ran and afghanistan. but now, a decade later, president back drama is not answering their calls for help. and the public still doesn seem to get it.that why this week ism joining veterans from across america as we take our stories to washington.veteran leaders from some 22 states are converging on the capitol to storm the hill, where well be pressing elected officials to confront and solve the backing. you can see their faces and read about their stories at the ran and afghanistan veterans of america webster, www.cava.org. they are an amazing group of men and women (and one dog) that have overcome tremendous obstacles. and now, there taking on another one: the va backing.just like weave been trained, we wont quit until the job is done. no matter how long it takes, well keep fighting.our brothers and sisters deserve support for their sacrifices. and every single american should stand with us to #endthevabacklog once and for all.ten years after the start of the ran war, there are a lot of folks who say they support the troops. now is the time for them to show it.http://www.can.com/2013/03/19/opinion/rieckhoff-veteran-benefit-loam/index.html?hot=hp_c2
1961,hoch industries, the wichita, an.-based company run by the millionaire hoch brothers, sent a voter information packet to 45,000 employees of its georgia pacific subsidiary earlier this month.in it was a letter, dated oct. 1, from hoch industries president dave robertson implicitly warning that many of our more than 50,000 u.s. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences of voting for president drama and other democrats in the 2012 elections, a list of conservative candidates the company political action committee endorsed and a pair of editorials: one, by david hoch, supporting mist money, and the other, by charles hoch, condemning drama.while we are typically told before each presidential election that it is important and historic, i believe the coming election will determine what kind of america future generations will inherit, robertson letter--first published by inthesetimes.com--begins. if we elect candidates who want to spend hundreds of billions in borrowed money on costly new subsidies for a few favored colonies, put unprecedented regulatory burdens on business, prevent or delay important new construction projects, and excessively hinder free trade, then many of our more than 50,000 u.s. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation, and other ills. this is true regardless of what your political affiliation might be.robertson letter continued:(in these times)to help you engage in the political process, we have enclosed several items in this packet. for most of you, this includes information about voter registration deadline and early voting option for your state. at the request of many employees, we have also provided a list of candidates in your state that have been supported by hoch companies or by the kochpac, our employee political action committee.i want to emphasize two things about these lists. first, and most important, we believe any decision about which candidates to support is -- as always -- yours and yours alone, based on the factors that are most important to you. second, we do not support candidates based on their political affiliation. we evaluate them based on who is the most market-based and willing to support economic freedom for the benefit of society as a whole.if you are concerned about our economy, our future and enhancing the quality of life for all americans, then i encourage you to consider the principles of your candidates and not just their party affiliation. it is essential that we are all informed and educated voters. our future depends on it.its not the first time hoch industries has sent employees political packets. just before the 2010 mister elections, hoch sent suffers an urgent matter that the nation said was full of alarming right-wing propaganda.last week, david siege, the founder and co of florida-based estate resorts, sent an email to employees informing them that layoffs are likely if drama is reflected:its quite simple. if any new taxes are levied on me, or my company, as our current president plans, i will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company. rather than grow this company i will be forced to cut back. this means fewer jobs, less benefits and certainly less opportunity for everyone.so, when you make your decision to vote, ask yourself, which candidate understands the economics of business ownership and who doesn? whose policies will endanger your job? answer those questions and you should know who might be the one capable of protecting and saving your job. while the media wants to tell you to believe the 1 percenters are bad, ism telling you they are not. they create most of the jobs. if you lose your job, it wont be at the hands of the 1%; it will be at the hands of a political hurricane that swept through this country.as baker noted, siege and his wife were the subjects of the queen of versailles, a recent documentary about their going quest to build the largest house in america. and siege has often claimed credit for george w. bushes victory over al more in the 2000 presidential race. (i had my managers do a survey on every employee [8,000 total], siege told bloomberg businessweek. if they liked bush, we made them register to vote. but not if they liked more.)siege and the hoch brothers are not alone in issuing anti-drama missiles to employees. according to msnbc, arthur allen, chief executive of as software solutions, wrote a similar email to his suffers on sept. 30:many of you have been with as for over 5, 10, 15, and even 20 years. as you know, together, we have been able to keep as an independent company while still growing our revenues and customers. but i can tell you, if the us re-elects president drama, our chances of staying independent are slim to none. i am already heavily involved in considering option that make our independence go away, and with that all of our lives would change forever. i believe that a new president and administration would give us citizens and the world the renewed confidence and optimism we all need to get the global economies started again, and give as a chance to stay independent. if we fail as a nation to make the right choice on november th, and we lose our independence as a company, i dont want to hear any complaints regarding the ballot that will most likely come.in the email, allen added: i am asking you to give us one more chance to stay independent by voting in a new president and administration on november th.http://news.yakov.com/blows/ticket/hoch-industries-sends-pro-money-packet-employees-195709471--election.html
1962,despite having had many incomplete (they didn get the back) and painful pp smear over the years, a gynecologist has only now discovered that my wife has a vagina which is at a high angle to the varix so pp smear need special equipment and why intercourse in the few time we had it was uncomfortable at best. so    is there a good position for intercourse that she will most likely enjoy ?
1963,http://www.whitehouse.go/state-of-the-union-2012did anyone watch the state of the union address last night?    what did you think of it?personally, i agreed with a lot of what the president had to say.    yes, there were some philosophical difference, but nothing really sent me reeling until i heard the statement... no ballots... no hand out.... (and i think he added no excuses)    to me, it seemed like he was almost trying to say that the ballots of the auto industry and the banking establishment were bad ideas.    he didn come right out and say it, but he did say that we (the american tax paper) are not going to do that ever again.as for the part that was along the lines of no excuses... my mind rushed straight to the talk of the bail out and stimulus package might not be enough.hand out?    solyndra....pretty much everything else was okay, but as i mentioned some philosophical differences that were expected.

1976,i realize this is very vague but perhaps you have some general information regarding my question. on two different occasions, with two different ophthalmologists, my husband was told he had a scar on his eye. each time the question of head trauma came up (he did fall from a height of about twenty feet years ago, resulting in an diagnosed concussion --    he experienced nausea and vomiting for several days post-injury --    and back problems). my husband never asked whether the scar was on the retina, the lens, the cornea, etc. so, does anyone have an idea where those examines may find such a scar and what may have caused it?thank you in advance for any and all efforts.jr

1987,does tylenol worse asthma for kiss?nor 20 feb 2012http://www.nor.org/blows/health/2012/02/20/147002356/does-tylenol-worse-asthma-for-kidsparents and doctors around the world have been alarmed by the dramatic increase in childhood asthma.one factor in the upswing is better detection by doctors, but at least one doctor thinks a common over-the-counter drug also has something to do with it.dr. john bride sees lots of kiss with asthma. hers a pediatric pulmonologist at akron children hospital in ohio. he knew of studies that raised concern about the safety of acetaminophen    brand name tylenol    to treat cold and fever in kiss with asthma. so he decided to look more closely at the research.i was stunned, he says. all the studies he looked at showed a link between asthma and acetaminophen.the more acetaminophen somebody takes, the more likely it is that they have asthma, he says. also, there an incredible consistency. everybody around the world who looked for this association has been able to find it.in asthma, the always of the lungs get blocked by mucous and narrow. that leads to wheeling and shortness of breath. the rise in asthma has closely parallel the increased use of acetaminophen.there are no scientific studies proving the meditation causes asthma, but bride says it may make asthma worse in kiss who already have it.nine-month-old matter cough and wheels as bride examines him and talks with his mon, ceased moore, about his asthma. he cough. he wheels. there are multiple symptoms, she says. he works very hard to breathe. when hers excited from crawling or even laughing, then he breathes really hard.in the past when matter got a cold, moore gave him tylenol. but that seemed to make his symptoms worse. at mcbride's suggestion, she stopped using it. then one day, her aunt was looking after matter when he had a cold.i told her dont give him tylenol, moore says. i didn specify that it was acetaminophen. she actually gave him a cold medicine, but it seemed to make him kind of worse. i looked at the active ingredient and acetaminophen was in the active ingredient.in fact, acetaminophen is an ingredient in many cough and cold products    including nyquil, robitussin and theraflu. it might exacerbate the asthma because it decreases levels of a molecule called glutathione, which protects the lungs.so removing the beneficial effect of glutathione exactly at a time children lungs are being irritated might end up being just one factor that contributes to the onset of an asthma attack, bride says.mcbride's recommendation? dont give acetaminophen to a child who has asthma. other doctors say its too soon for that advice.many other factors could play a role in the rise of asthma, according to dr. stanley seller, head of pediatric pharmacology at national jewish health in denver. vitamin d insufficiency, dietary changes, air pollution or better control of infections are perhaps all related to the increasing prevalence of asthma, he says.johnson & johnson, maker of tylenol, said in a statement that the medicine has been used safely and effectively for more than 50 years. there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies that show a causal link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in tylenol, and asthma, the company said.its important to control a child fever, seller says. bride agrees but says ibuprofen is a safer bet    at least until going studies provide answers about the safety of acetaminophen for kiss with asthma.

1996,i went to the eye doctor yesterday, and i got a prescription for stasis for my dry eyes. along with that, i got a prescription for lothman, for more immediate relief (to help prevent inflammation i guess). i remember that my doctor said to put one drop of the stasis in my eyes once in the morning, and once at night, but i canst remember what he said for the lothman. i think he said one drop in each eye four times a day, but i might be thinking of theaters, which we didn get. does four times a day sound like too much? it makes me nervous to use it because they said it was a osteoid, so i definitely dont want to use it too much. ism 19 years old, and have worn glasses since i was 9 (and i live in the desert), if that helps.
1997,i went to the dentist on wednesday 04/02/08 to have old filling removed and i did have a cavity which was cleaned out.    that afternoon...the feelings came back except for the left side of my tongue...it feels swollen at times and definitely numbness is there....burning sensation at times and i cannot taste food on that side.    i was brushing my teeth and tongue on that side and i could feel the heaviness of the toothbrush but not the sensation like the right side of my tongue.    this is quite annoying...and after reading from others who are having the same problem i am hopeful that this will eventually subside or go away.    is there any thing i can do to hurry up the process?.this discussion is related tongue and jaw numbness after lower wisdom extraction.
1998,for the past 3 days i have had numbness and pain on the left side of my face, primarily around the eye, cheekbones and cheek.    one day after this pain began i developed a mouth ulcer on the left side of my hard palate.    i have no symptoms of sinus infection (absolutely no congestion), no eye tearing, no symptoms of a palsy.    my left eye hurts a little when i blink, my face hurt to touch and the pain stops on the left side of my nose.    a couple of years ago i developed a similar feeling of numbness and tingling on one side of my face, from my scalp across the left side down to my neck.    at that time i went to the er to have a stroke ruled out.    those symptoms resolved after about 3 days and have returned periodically (2-3 times a year).    this time seems to be a little worse, with more pain and the mouth ulcers.    i have racked my brain (and the internet) trying to figure out what up.    any ideas?    thanks for your help
1999,i had tennis multifocal lens implanted about 1 month ago.    i am having halls, glare, lack of contrast in colors, diminished depth perception, things look hay, but my near vision is ok.    surgeon thinks it is due to astigamatism and wants to do pre to correct it, but he thinks it may not make me happy.    he thinks i should consider removing that lens and replacing it with a monofocal lens.should i expect the vision problems to decrease over time.    i was hoping to have perfect vision, but is that not realistic?    i was wondering if others have experienced these problems and had them go away, over time, or if this is, unfortunately, normal for lens plants.    should i get the plants removed.please help

2002,my nine or old daughter has been trading many of her toys in which she always gives expensive items away in exchange for bubble gum machine items. when i find this out, i make her return the items and get her things back, but i think most of the time i am unaware of it, until i realize something is missing. i suspect she traded her intend is, since it vanished a while back. she recently confessed when i was looking for my $400.00 heart diamond necklace, that she traded it to the 9 or old neighbor boy for $1.00. of course, the boy canst seem to find it, so i will not get this back. the boys mother believes the boy, when he told her that my daughter kept resting him for the trade. my daughter tells me that he was the one coaxing her to get the necklace. i believe her. she has been trading expensive items with this same boy quite often, in which i made her go to his house and get her items back. the mother said she was not aware of all of the trading going on. first i want to say, i thought i was a good mother. my kiss never went without anything, for the most part, they have more than most of their friends have. my questions are: why does my daughter not understand or seem to care about the value of things. why does she continue to do this? i ground her and take her things away for punishment, but she does it again. in my opinion, i think my neighbors 9 or old boy was wrong also, and i think they should offer to help pay for the loss. am i wrong here? the response i got from the mother is that her children would never lie, cheat or steal, and they seem to doubt the value of my necklace, since i have no receipt. this necklace had clot of diamonds and a very good chain. i feel betrayed by my own daughter, she said she is sorry, but i really dont think she understands the value and the wrong doing. i am very stressed over this and need some good advice. thanks!
2003,http://inplainsight.nbcnews.com/news/2013/04/22/17840373-poverty-in-america-millions-of-families-too-broke-for-bank-accounts?litesabino fences-ranches hid $25,000 all around his house because he didn trust banks. masonic christ receives her was-mary salary on a pre-paid debit card. him james was homeless for most of the past decade in part because she had no place to save money.there are plenty of reasons people still live all-cash lives, but the sheer number who do it might surprise you. at a time when the majority of americans use online banking, and some even deposit checks using their telephone camera, roughly eight percent of americans 115 million households don  t have a checking or savings account, according to census data complied by the did.the numbers are far higher among minorities: more than 20 percent of african-americans and hispanics are essentially left out of the american banking system.frozen in the cash-only past, they face myriads   kick-them-while-they-are-down   situations where getting money costs money. banks typically charge $6 to cash checks. want to secure an apartment? fee-based money orders are the only option. without credit cards, they must turn to triple-digit interest rate payday loans for emergencies.span>masonic christ of jackson, miss., tries to avoid getting paid in checks, but when her state tax refund for $231 arrived recently, she had to pay $7 to cash it at a nearby convenience store.christ works at was-mary. her paychecks are deposited onto a repaid debit card -- an improvement over old-fashioned paper paychecks, which led to high check-washing fees. it  s hardly a good substitute for direct deposit, however. one cash withdrawal per period is free, but others cost $2. she can avoid the fee by shopping at was-mary and getting cash back at checkout.she is among the 60 percent of unwanted americans who previously had a checking account. christ used to share one with her sister, but it cost her dearly.there was an overdraft here and an overdraft there, and it just didn work out, she said.him james at the dove house, a half-way house in durham, no that helped her get back on her feet after struggles with poverty and addition.fences-ranches made a fairly good living working for a tree removal company in lumber bridge, n.c., for about 10 years. but he was skeptically of banks, and when he tried to open an account, he was surprised by the cost.instead of making money, i would have to pay fees, he said, through a translator. (so) we used to keep money in the house. we were always trying to look for ways to hide the money in the house and keep it safe.at one time, fences-ranches had $25,000 smashed in different places throughout the house    his latin community had been plagued by house burglaries because neighbors did the same. when his wife got cancer, her treatments devoured all their savings. down to their last $500, and before she passed away, she convinced him to open a bank account at latin community credit union, which was opened in part to help stem the burglars problem.  she managed the money, and was disciplined enough to avoid spending it, said fences-ranches, 37, who now raises five children alone. (i) sometimes see something and i am tempted to buy it ... now the money is in the bank.  saving -- putting money out of temptations reach -- is the core concept of consumer banking. but the importance of participating in the financial system has stretched far beyond the quaint notion of interest, said jennies teacher, co of the center for financial services innovation, who is generally regarded as the person responsible for popularizing the term unwanted.a bank account in a way has become like a passport or a drivers license, said teach. its a kind of access device.james, 55, has been in and out of hopelessness for several years.    she now lives at a half-way house called dove house in durham, n.c., and figured she could never move into her own apartment unless she could smash away the money needed for a security deposit. without a savings account, that was a challenge.cash in hand is cash spent, my mother always said, she said.two years ago, she met duke university student janet xiv, who was part of a group named the community empowerment fund, which visited dove house offering life skill training, including a class on personal finance where she nudged women to open a bank account.    james was reluctant.its really demoralizing to open up an account and have it sitting in there with no money in it, xiv said.   i think most folks want to take one step at a time, and get a job first. also, there is this fear of being charged fees you dont understand.  when james got a part-time job in january, she finally took up xiv  s offer of help.    the two set up an account with the self-help credit union on xiv  s lawton right at the dove house kitchen table.she even put the first $5 in there for me, james said. after depositing her first paycheck in person at self-help, xiv said, james did a little dance.  now whenever i get even $10 or $20, i go to the bank and deposit it,   james said. within a few months, she put together enough to pay her security deposit and first  s month  s rent. as soon as she saves enough for a bed, she  ll move in.james has been able to start banking again through the self help credit union, and has saved enough to pay a security deposit and the first months rent for her own apartment..saving for the future'self-help is part of a growing set of financial companies called community development financial institutions (cutis). supported by the u.s. treasury department, their mission is to help the unwanted get into the financial system.  you make sure people are getting products and services they need,   said mark pink ,co of the opportunity finance network, which helps fund cutis.   banks may be the best place, they may not, but we dont want to just leave them vulnerable to the predator out there.  christ has recently been persuaded to open an account in a different way. her 3-year-old twins   day-care facility was recently visited by representatives of the mississippi college savings account program, who helped her open a small account for the children. she then realized she needed her own savings account.i want to be a good role model for them, so they can learn about savings, she said.    i know i need to be better and show them about saving for the future.

2007,loops!    this is the first time i have ever posted on a site, and i forgot to give prospective posters more information; please forgive me.my 47-year-old sister has been drinking heavily for the last 20 years.    about a month ago, during her sixth veto in a year, she suffered a seizure and was out of her head (wet brain?) for about twelve hours in er.    the hospital ran all sorts of tests and said that her liver enzymes were elevated and the seizure was alcohol-related.    a week ago her ankles became very swollen (sheds only about 100 les soaking wet, w/the big alcoholic belly) w/one leg swollen all the way to her knee, became jaundice, and developed ascites.    her chest is completely covered w/red simply-looking spider veins.    the doctors drained her abdomen and only retrieved 1.5 liners of liquid.    her abdomen still looked like she was at least seven months pregnant.    the sonographer said she was still very distended because of her enlarged liver.    sheds only eating about one small meal a day; she says it kills her to eat.    she must lie down for about an hour after every meal to relieve her pain.    she is sleeping about 11 hours a day; we dont know if its due to her new night shift or just another symptom of the cirrhosis.    weave yet to hear the results of her procedure (one week later!) so of course i have been searching the internet for answers and thinking the worst.    can anyone offer some answers about what to expect?    thank you.

2009,washington (cubs/a) it may sound like a james bond cadet, but the da has just approved a miniature telescope - smaller than a pea - that can help with a leading cause of blindness for seniors when implanted inside the eye.how does it work?surgeons put the implacable miniature telescope in one eye, allowing the person to improve central vision for tasks like reading, watching to and recognizing faces. doctors leave the other eye alone to provide peripheral vision.http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20009834-10391704.html?tag=latestthe trick here is that the brain must fuse the two different views into a single image. the food and drug administration says patients will need post-surgery rehabilitation to make that happen.the invention doesn work for everyone.according to dr. malvinas eydelman, the days ophthalmic devices chief, the device is specifically feared for a sunset of the nearly 2 million americans with advanced macular degeneration - those 75 and older, with a certain degree of vision loss, who also need a attract removed.in a 219-patient study, the da said 90 percent of telescope recipients had their vision improve by at least two lines on an eye chart, and three-quarters went from severe to moderate vision impairment.its not a miracle cure cautioned ophthalmic surgeon dr. kathryn coley of harvard and the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary in bostonwe're not giving people back 20-year-old eyes, she said.but by magnifying images onto more of the retina than its diseased center, someone who before couldn see an entire face might now miss only the nose, said coley, who helped lead manufacturer visionary ophthalmic technologies' study of the plant.and its not risk free.concern about damage to the inside lining of the cornea, the eyes clear front covering that helps focus light, held up da approval for several years. in that study, 10 eyes had serious cornea swelling, five that required cornea transplant. days eydelman said the company proposed candidate restrictions to minimize that risk, and will study how an additional 770 recipients fare after sales begin.in fact, the da took the highly unusual step of requiring that patients and their surgeons sign a detailed acceptance of risk agreement before surgery, acknowledging potential side effects -- including cornea damage and worsted vision -- and the need for lots of testing to determine who a candidate.visionary, of saratoga, calf., is seeking medicine coverage for the surgery and read costs, a package that it calls centrasight. the company wouldn estimate total costs but said the device itself costs $15,000.

2025,i know this is a little different than normal. my question is not about my child but my childhood. i have been reading the posts of parents whose children frequently masterbate. i am 31 years old and i am dealing with morbid obeasity. i think it is linked to my childhood masterbation(masturbation). i dont remember when i started i think about 3    but at some point my sister did it with me. i think about 7 or so she is 2 years younger.    i am not sure why or how this started but i would saddle her and rub against her until i got off, at other times she was on top. i also rubbed against anything else i could find. i was obsessed with sex and had sexual thoughts about men in my family. i knew that this was wrong but i couldn stop it. i always felt like there was something wrong with me and i was bad. i recently asked my mon if i was sexually abused but she says there is no way because she was too overprotecive. i know this is a long question but i am desperate for an answer. is what i experienced as a child normal or did i sexually abuse my sister?

2027,my 5 or old is also printing in inappropriate places.    have read several other cases here on this forum with the same issue.    the only commonality that jumps out at me between these children seems to be that there all, or at least the majority are, underdeveloped somehow.    my son was 2 months early.    he is developmental about 6 months behind his peers.    could this be some freedman desire to remain a baby?    ism at my wits in.    last week he decided printing on the hall stairs would be fun.    he soaked the first three stairs.    this morning he promptly got up, and went into his toy room and need on another one of his carpet squares.    (thank goodness they are carpet squares!)    he sees outside when ism not looking and the worst was last week when he need in the middle of my bed!    tips please!    this is unacceptable!    now when guests come over, ism afraid that i haven got all the smell out and the house smells like a cat box.    ah yes, the cat box; another of his favorite places to see!    he also delegates there and does that outside also.this discussion is related behavior problem of printing on toys and carpet.

2030,i have a wonderful 5 year old child he is smart funny imaginative and loving.    but i just dont know what is going on with him.    he is very defiant, he argues with me about everything i tell him to do, he seems to think the rules dont apply to him.    he gets angry very easily and physically lashes out at other kiss and my 7 year old daughter. he seems to meet qualifications for many disorders including add, odd, social anxiety disorder intermittent explosive disorder and possibly could.    i am taking him for a porch eva, but i am afraid they may tell me to put him on meditation which i am very resistant to do.    depression i-polar, and anxiety disorders run rampart in my family.    i just want him to be happy, and to grow up having a happy fulfilling life.    i try not to sank as i think this reinforced aggressive behavior, i have tried time out but he kicked his bedroom window out, slipped his to off the dresser, and destroyed his room.    recently our cat had kitten and one of them scratched him so he threw the kitten against the wall causing it to have a seizure and a broken leg.    i punished him by not allowing him to play in his baseball game the next day and not going outside for three days.    the thing that concerns me the most is that this is really not his nature. he is very kind, affectionate and loving, it seems almost like he suddenly turns into another kid. i try to stick to my rules but every single thing with him is a battle.    i want him to go to counselling after his evil and he will receive in school counselling in the fall. i would even like to take a printing class for parents with difficult children.    another thing that i think could possibly be related is he will only poor in his parts, he sees in the toilet just fine, but he will poor in his parts whenever wherever and he wont even tell me it happened he just goes on about his playing until i smell him.    i have heard that kiss to this as a form of control, but i dont understand why.    i took him to the do. and he gave me a stool softer but he refuses to take it.    his sense of taste and smell have always been very keen, and he can tell if i try to mix it in his juice or cereal.    i just wish i could help him and find out why he is so mad all of the time.
2031,he is 6 years old. he did not send him to school for 6 months because of we have shifted some other place.    earlier he went to school without giving trouble to us.    now he is crying everyday to go to school.    he is not at all showing any interest to go to school and he is telling that he wants to sit in the home only and want to talk to his mother.    the teacher complained that he is crying continuously.he has a language problem.    in school they are teaching in english, some times he is unable to understand it.please give us an suggestion that how will we send him to school.    he is going to school since 10 days.

2034,please help!    my son, who is 8 and has been diagnosed with sensory integration disorder, has a very strange issue with his belly button and lately with his underarms.    he cannot stand for anyone to touch his belly button, even if he laughs, he says it is very painful.    he holds his hand over his naval even if he has a shirt on, and now he says if his arms are not tight to his body he has a feeling that someone is touching him under his arms and it hurts.    he cry often about this. he cannot write sometimes because of this sensation he has. please, can you give me any direction to what i can do to help this little guy?    no one seems to know or have ever heard of this. he is a very right kid, has a hard time making friends because of the way he acts, even though he cannot help it.    thank you in advance.
2035,i was admitted with appendicitis confirmed with a it scan.    it was retrocecal and my caecum was more in the middle rather than the over to the right. i wanted a laparoscopic excision, but my surgeon shouted at me when i asked about this and proceeded to do a midwife laparotomy.    what were the reasons for not performing a laparoscopic removal?    my surgeon wouldn tell me, but i am still curious.    i am slim 28 year old male and i am concerned that when i resume my normal activities that i will be at increased risk of a hernia because of this.    thank you.
2036,my child is almost three, very active and behaves dangerously (runs in front of cars, jumps of high things etc.). i am quite sure he has add am am very curious about the reason of this. i drank on the first day after conception, smoked during the first 2 weeks and did not start parental vitamin until 3 weeks after (of course because i was not aware of pregnancy). the remainder of the pregnancy was extremely healthy. she was one week late (41 weeks) and at check up found she had popped in the water and heartfelt was not well either. immediately i had to go to the hospital where i was induced, but each time a contraction came the heartfelt would slow down too much. the next morning a c-section was done as the same thing happened when trying again in the morning.could you please tell me if any of these situations could have to do with my daughters behavior ? thank you so muchthis discussion is related impulsive 3 1/2 year old.
2037,i had smartly dont exactly the 3 months ago and i look exactly the same. the first few weeks i actually felt like i had a flat stomach and was so excited, but now i look the same as before the surgery.i am already a tiny girl, but i always had an issue with my stomach. the first few weeks i felt like i had that flat stomach i wanted, but now i look press again.it has been 3 months now and i am worried i just spent all of that money, time, and pain on nothing!any advice or feedback would be really appreciated!!!!!!
2038,my son was    diagnosed with add 3 most. ago. he is 13 almost 14 yes. old, his father and i divorced 6 yes. ago and we have joint custody of him and our other 9 or. old son. for 2 yes. now my 13 or. does not ever bring books home from school and says he does his homework at school. i have a problem with this because he had to go to summer school last year, and get phone calls from teachers almost every day because he curses them and wont leave other students alone and disrupt almost every class. well, my wake-up call was in nov. of 08', one of his teachers calls to tell me that he was sitting on another students desk and after several times of telling him to get off of the desk he got up and the top of the desk broke, a screw popped out and hit the teacher in the eye. well, we take him to the dr. and he sends me to a psychiatric. they ran some tests on him at the hospital and turned out he does have add. the dr. prescribed hi,m ability 2.legs. daily. also melanin at night for good rest, the st night on the melanin he wet the bed. i called the do back that day and she told me to take him off of the melanin. still bedwetting occasionally. on april 1 2009 he got very angry because he had to go to the dr. again. and refused to get into my car when i picked him up at his days, he asked his grand(step) where the key to his days gun cabinet is that he wanted to shoot me or worse himself. i called the police because i canst control him and neither could his step-grand.the police made him get in my car and go to the dr. and told us to make sure that all the guns are removed from the days home. the pediatrician took him off of the ability and sent us back to therapy, well my son refuses to go there again also. on my week with the boys on 4/28/09 my son was constantly hitting on his little brother so i tried to discipline him by putting him in his room and that did not work, he told me several times he rates me and wishes i would die! he also telling his little brother to tell me the same thing. i took him to a new psychiatric yesterday and he says he thinks that he does not have add so i am very confused. it is not normal to tell your own mother you hate her let alone, tell her to die. this has been going on for a year now, cursing me all the time, staying out all the time as late as he wants. i feel like i am a failure as a mother and that it is my fault but i know this is another wake-up call for me and i dont what to do and feel like there is nowhere else to turn. the father of my son refuses to go to any doctors with us and i need some advise very, very desperately! keep in mind this psychiatrists insist that i give up my every other week with him, keep him away from his little brother and life should be better for my son if he stays with his dad!!!! not normal to me at all because he is trying to sound like a lawyer instead of a psychiatric which happens to be a friend of the days family. please help!!!    thank you, very confused!this discussion is related aggressive behavior.
2039,i hope someone can help me ...i have been with my partner for the past 11 years, and married for the past 1.5 years.my mayo step daughter (whom i have known since a young child) has been stealing items and money from her mother, father, myself and others (boarding students at her mother  s house) for almost a year now.    her stealing has excavated over time to the point where 2 weeks ago she was caught using her mother  s credit card that she had apparently been using unbeknownst to anyone for quite some time now.    when she was found out, her mother slapped her in the face and kicked her out of her house.over the past few months, i have approached and given her a talking to on each occasion she had stolen my things (change and cosmetic), but her stealing seems to have excavated.    she seems a bit young in the head for her age, and maybe for this reason, my husband (in my opinion) does not dish out adequate discipline.    even before i learned about the credit card incident, i had stopped trusting her and made it very clear that this was the case.after being kicked out of her mothers house, she arrived on our footstep wanting to stay.my problem here is that i do not trust her anymore, and for this reason do not want her to stay at our house.    my husband does not care about what i think or feel about this and has insisted that she stay with us regardless.    this may sound like the responsible thing to do, but as i have lost trust in her, this situation is causing me so much stress it is now making me very angry, sick in the stomach, and interfering with my work.because her mother hit her, the authorities are now involved and it looks like they want her to stay at our house away from the mother (i was never consulted). it looks like sheds with us to stay indefinitely.as a stepparent i am/feel powerless over this whole sage.    i think this powerlessness and fear (of being stolen from) is contributing toward my anger, and i am now wondering if i have made a bad mistake marrying into this mess.    i saw a counsellor last week who suggested that we seek relationship counselling, but my husband just got angry when i mentioned this - insisting that he has no problem.    trust is something very important to me, but when i tell him that i no longer trust her, he tells me to get over it - as though remaining trust in someone is like getting over a cold or something.if anyone can offer any suggestions ind appreciate the communication as i really dont know how much more of this i can take...your thoughts are appreciated.
2040,my 3 1/2 year old son has been hitting and biting. my sons father was recently given 50/50 time sharing. my son has been mad at me because of this. he tells me why i left him at his days too long. he will not play by himself any more, and stays by my side. when hers trying to show affection he hits me instead. he sleeps with me now and doesn want to be alone. what is he going through? how can i help him?
2041,my 3 1/2 or old wont wear parts. it came out of nowhere after having a high fever of 105. degrees, since then, she will not wear any parts, not even come sweat parts or panama parts. she will cry, throw a screaming fit, and constantly try pulling them off, even as we are going out the door. she only wants to wear nightgowns, and she does not want to leave the house, even to go do her favorite activities, i have to force her to leave the house. she would rather go to bed or lay around than get dressed to go somewhere. she will wear shirts though, its just parts that she has a problem with.she keeps giving me different excuses why she doesn want to wear parts, like she gets too hot, she has a stomach ache, headache, the biggest reason is she says her knees hurt. i tried everything from giving her tylenol to rubbing icy hot on her knees telling her that it will make them feel better. i dont know what to believe, but it seems to be related to the high fever. before that happened, she loved her clothes. when she got a new pair of parts she would practically live in them all day and all night. she would get mad if i had to wash them, so now she is acting the complete opposite out of nowhere. i dont think it is a power struggle, because she is a really good kid and i have away let her pick out her own clothes, and like i said before, she loved her clothes before this. i think it might have to do with the fever, but i dont know what to do about it since i canst really tell if it is a physical problem, psychological, or both. if you could please send me any advice on what is going on, i would really appreciate it. do you think she could be developing a sensitivity disorder?
2042,7 years after breast cancer, mastectomy, reconstruction & trap flap surgery, i am experiencing tight, wrenching pain when bending over during you. sometimes it is on the right side (where there is a large visible bulge when i lay down and lift my head) other times it is directly under the breast area near the sternum. i have had 2 doctors    (my oncologist & a surgeon) tell me it looks like a hernia. the surgeon ordered a cat scan with contrast and that awful wasting radium, and now reports he sees no evidence of hernia, and no other testing indicated. so i am back to square one and out of pocket expenses are rising with no firm answer for what is causing the pain. my original plastic surgeon is not someone i trust as i was never satisfied with the scarring afterward or his follow up on questions i had. i realize that diagnosis is difficult for many doctors but how can you dismiss obvious problems like dislike pain, by saying its not a hernia, so it must be nothing of concern? that does not make sense. is there anyone out there who is able to help me with this?
2043,the doctor said i am not absorbing any nutrition value from my food intake,and am losing weight i can not afford to lose.i am 52 and weigh only 95 les..my average weight is 115,but doctor said i was going to either away and die. i eat clot of food for a person my size, but can not put any weight on. blood tests revealed nothing out of the ordinary and wanted to know if there is something someone knows to have me get checked or knows about this condition, because my doctor knows not what to do for me. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks!!!
2044,i have had a colostomy for over two years . for many years, my stool was pretty well formed and fairly regular i only had to drink prone juice to have a bowel movement. about three years ago, i started to occasionally have to ask for something to help me (milk of magnetic or lactulose). then, i had surgery through my back to remove kidney stones twice. after the first surgery, i want having bowel movements, so the hospital doctor put me on alternating days milk of magnetic and lactulose. in other words, a laxative every day. this worked fine . then after the second surgery, it started not to work. since then, i have been on different kinds of laxatives. most of them have worked at first and then my stool started turning bushy which is unusual for me. ism now on lactulose two times a day (15-30 c. ) this worked well at the beginning, but my stool was very much again which is unusual for me, although it is now becoming usual since ism on the laxatives. ism totally paralyzed and have a neurogenic bowel, so my bowel has basically stopped working without the laxatives. now the lactulose is getting so that its not working as well. ism just out of point where i dont know what to do. have asked about irrigation here at the nursing home, but no one seems to know anything about it. what can i do??? what kind of doctor would i see about my colostomy? have never had any problems, so have never seen a doctor. if anyone can help me, i would so appreciate it. does anyone irrigate? how do you learn how to do it? do you to where my colostomy is, i always had formed stools until the forgeries. from what have read, this makes me a good candidate for irrigation. i really need some help here!!!
2045,year male, i have taken 50mg aloft once a day and my klonopin once a day for 9 months. i never had brain caps now i get them everytime especially when i move my head. last time i took my medicine was 53 days ago and i happened down. in so scared
2046,i am 53 yes. old and post-menopausal for 5 years. i am schedule for an abdominal hysterectomy in july.    have been told i have a 9 cm uterine fibroid and my uterus is about twice the size it should be.    one ovary was visualized with an abdominal ultra sound, the other could not be visualized by abdominal ultra sound or transvaginally.    if i ever had fibroid(s) previously, i was not aware of them.    the worst menopausal symptoms have experienced were during peri-menopause.    i had night sweats for a good five or six years and still have them once in a while, but its certainly bearable.following is what confused me.    as part of a routine physical, i had laws drawn on a saturday.    on monday, i started feeling really clumsy, almost like i was coming down with the fly.    by tuesday and wednesday, i was really aching and chilly.    by late wednesday, i had severe pelvic pain and pressure.    the dr.is office called on wednesday with the lab results.    i remarked that i was glad they were calling, because something had to be wrong with me, i felt really awful.    they said i had gout!    my uric acid was high which indicated i had gout.    i didn have symptoms one usually thinks of with gout - no hot joints, just ache all over.    she suggested that since i had never suffered from gout before, sometimes the first flare-up can be scattered.    she also said i was dehydrated.    i explained the symptoms i was experiencing, telling the person it felt like my uterus was going to fall out.    i told her if i hadn had a period for 5 years, i would swear i was suffering from menstrual cramps.    she said, dehydration could contribute to some of my pain, advised me to over hydrate and if i didn feel better the next day, to call and come in.i went to the days. (up) office on thursday.    urinalysis revealed red blood cells in my urine.    the no asked if i could be constipated.    (sorry, this is really tm.) i felt i was having a bowel problem, since i hadn had a bowel movement for a couple of days.    ism someone who regularly has at least 2 ms a day, so, after 2 days, i felt this could be a problem.    they x-prayed my abdomen and the no said there didn appear to be enough there to cause the pain i was experiencing.    she performed a pelvic exam.    she said my uterus was enlarged.    i need to explain here, my past two pp smear have been difficult, if not impossible to accomplish.    in 2007, my gone missed obtaining any cervical cells to test and didn even know it until the test came back with nothing to test.    the gone explained since i was post-menopausal and not sexually active, my uterus had shriveled (my words, not his) and moved up very high.    apparently, my croix is very small also.    i had two children by c-section. the gone dilated my croix and was able to acquire a smear.    the next year, 2008, the gone no could not get a sample and i often to try vagifem insects and they were able to complete the pp smear in january, 2009.    they had to use an extra-long, very thin spectrum to perform the pp smear both times. i explain all this because from january to april, my shriveled uterus was now twice the size it should be.the up no referred me for the abdominal and transvaginal ultra sounds which led me to check in with my gynecologist.    he said i certainly had pathology that warranted a hysterectomy, but he was agreeable to waiting a few months, doing the ultra sounds again, and see where we go from there.    i asked if there was any way he could tipsy the fibroid to make a decision.    he said no, there want anyway to do that except with hysterectomy.    he said he truly doubted there was any malignancy.    he advised that usually, with uterine cancer, post-menopause, there would be bleeding.    he explained, and i know from my own research, fibroids are seldom malignant (1%?), but, he had no explanation as to how or why a fibroid would develop and/or grow so large, post-menopausal.    so, have often for the hysterectomy.i know this has gone on way too long, and i apologize.    the internet can be a very good place to perform research, but it also can be a very scar place if you search too much.    have run onto web sites decaying unnecessary hysterectomies.    the complications they cite are really scar, e.g., nothing to support the bladder and/or bowel after removing the uterus, something call a rectocele, pelvic floor problems.    i dont want to suffer bladder or bowel leakage if it turns out i could have waited to have the hysterectomy.    but, on the other hand, have also read that sometimes, a malignancy is discovered within a fibroid that would have existed for years before creating problems.    i dont want to wait 6 months or a year only to eventually have the surgery and be told it is malignant after all and if only i had done something sooner...ind appreciate any thoughts or ideas anyone can contribute.    were all these issues related or just incidental?    i feel okay now.    ever so often, i feel slight pain in my lower abdomen, a kind of pitching pain.    i will appreciate input from the group.thanks,
2047,i have been very fortunate to work from home and care for my daughter since she was born, she is now turning 3.    sometimes i wonder how we survived this long financially, but we did and we are grateful and feel very blessed.    we have reached a breaking point, and out of financial necessity i need to return to work outside of the home full-time.while from a very large family, i do not have family or friends that can care for alexis while i go to work.    this time in my life, has by far been the most emotional time for me.    my concerns?    many to say the least.    i am afraid my relationship will change with alexis.    she is so attached to me and i feel like i am abandoning her.    how will she possible understand going from being with me twelve hours a day to just a few at night?    how will these daycares ever really understand her and be able to work through the battles that i face with her day-to-day.    i am so sad and so worried this transition is going to be horrible for both of us.in alexis defense, she loves to play!    and when i say play, i mean all day.    often beyond what i can offer energy wise.    maybe being around kiss all day will be good for her.    maybe me getting out of the house will be good for me.    has anyone gone through this that can offer me some advice.    thanks:)

2051,my child has always been an awful sleeper.    always waking up at night.    i have tried anything that anyone has ever suggested. even tried a major bribe (buying her a cat if she stayed in bed for 3 months). that worked for about 6 months. eventually, she started getting out of bed again....anywhere from one to six times a night. so, i kept threatening to take her cat away. i followed through.    took her cat to stay with grand until my daughter stayed in bed again. life was good!now, here we are 6 months later. now, she wont go to sleep.    takes her hours, and repeated trips back to her room.    i have tried comfort talk, consequences, and even resorted to sparks.    nothing works.i dont understand this.    her bedtime routine is consistent.i honestly feel like in ready to run! i can take this anymore.    i would thought that by the age of 6, shed finally just sleep well.what can i/we do????
2052,i was just sitting here fuming again because i saw a reply of the main/drama debate from before the election.    the one when main said these people are expecting the government to pay for transplant and such, these are cosmetic elective forgeries.    i know the election is over, but i just was wondering if anybody else caught that.    thank god he was not elected.
2053,my wife and i have been raising out 4 or old grand daughter since sept 2008. she was 2 yes old at the time. in april 2009 she was diagnosed with stream sarcoma(bone cancer). we were devastated, and we were really torn with seasons that we were having to make almost immediately. she treatment plan was to go through them for 34 weeks, and have her left leg amputated in 10 weeks. my wife kept working thought all of this and i was the care take who would spend 5 - 6 days and nights at the hospital. my wife would come at the evenings and spend the weekend there. during all of this, i was taught to do things that the nurses were trained to do. things that were painful to our grand daughter. but i did them regardless, because it was the right thing to do. our granddaughter hated me for this. verbally and physically. most of the time she would tell me to leave and that i was mean. over time it really got to me that i just wanted to quite. but i love her and could not stop. we have been home now since january. she still continues to see me as the bad guy. most other times she loves me and loves to play with me. still i want to run and give up. the real problems is that my wife is the opposite. she allows her to do things that i say no too. this makes our grand daughter see me as what he says doesn matter. grand will give me that. ism mad at both grand and granddaughter. have read that younger children will do things because they dont understand. that we are supposed to respond with a positive answer, and explain to them why we are doing it. but the hurt and angry that she throws at me really hurts. i feel like have stopped my life to take care of her and she owes me. that really sounds bad, but that how i feel. dont get me wrong, i would do it all over again if i had to. i love her to pieces and if god or whoever could give me her issues, i would take them in a minute. she is too young to have to go through what she is going through.ism very tired. we spend 5 days a week driving 30 minutes each way to doctors apt. usually 1 to 2 hours at the appointment. then 30 min back. not to include getting her dressed and breakfast. then i take her to school, then i go to work and work 8 hours. there is not enough hours in a day, and not enough days in a week. ism very tired.ism just complaining. looking for someone out there with similar issues, and maybe some suggestions on how i can handle life little betterthanks for listening.
2054,my 5 year old son has been getting sad faces every day in kindergarten.    there are always multiple comments from his teacher, mostly with regard to not working when others are working, talking in the bathroom, crawling around on the floor, and not walking nicely in line.    he can be very obstinate at home. it seems as everything is met with defiance (i dont want to....). he tends to grunt or stop when asked to do something.    even though he has learned his sight words and perform well academically, he always voices that he doesn want to learn...that he would rather play.    he can read all of his sight words but will read with an exasperated voice.    all he wants to do is play!    as with many other 5 year old boys, he is very self centered, does not like to share, rates to lose at anything.    he has a 2 year old brother and they are typical in terms of getting along one minute and fighting the next. i feel like he has changed since his brother was born.    his brother is almost 3 now! should we not be seeing some changes.    my husband and i take away privileges, sank when deemed appropriate, and send him to his room for time out.    we set up a reward system and that worked for about 2 weeks but he returned to acting out behavior in school.    when in preschool his last year before kindergarted he often got reports of being disobedience by the teachers (this was a christian academy).    when asked why he acts out he will often reply, because i wanted to or i thought about it doing it and i did it. i am at my wits end.    naturally, my thoughts go to add or opposition defiant disorder.    i feel guilty because i am beginning to dislike my child.    please help!

2056,my 8 or old daughters belly button is infected in some way.    it has mucus around and sheds not sick or anything, so i am just concerned where this is coming from? could you please help me.
2057,i am worried that my 7 year old daughter is showing signs of anti social behaviour. after 3 years at school she has not made any (close) friends and rarely gets invited for play dates. i am working sum so after school she is taken care off by a nancy (who also takes care of our younger daughter who is 2.5). my nancy tells me that at play dates in my house she is boss and expects her guest to play only games she ( = my daughter) wants to play. in general, if things dont go her way she can get quite rude and unpleasant. this year she has had some problems with her social skill at school as well - the school told me that she plays rough and she was also mean to some of the younger kiss. after me working closely with school and monitoring her behaviour - these incidents stopped for 6 months or so but then started again couple of weeks ago. i cannot think of any real reason why she would start to play up again. academically she is very strong and has had highest marks in her first exam.it is important to note that she was only child for 5 years and is still quite jealous of her younger sister. i have also noticed that she has started to lie in order to get herself out of trouble.yesterday she went for a play date at the house of one of the boys from her school - they had play dates before at my house and my nancy told me that they dont get on particularly well as they seem to be too much of the same behaviour. anyway - the afternoon was hell!!!. his poor mother was so stressed and tired by the end of it that i felt a need to write her a long e-mail apologizing for everything. this mother told me that my daughter was apparently really boss, attention seeking, lying and even used f word (not sure where does it come from!)...all in all - at her worst behaviour.i had a long talk with her last night but have doubts that it will make much difference.how do i get though to her as i am worried that if she continues like this she will be labelled for her poor social skill?am
2058,hi i have 2 year old(birthday in april) trifles. one of the trifles is very hyper and active and loud. she also does a strange thing with her dinner and other cotton like items. it started about 4 or 5 months ago with blankets. she pick at the blanket until she gets a bit of the cotton off and then drags the cotton across her lips for a minute or so and then losses the cotton. now she is doing it with parts of the outside of her dinner. she gets a pretty good amount of cotton off the side stretch part of the papers and drags them across her lips and then throws them in her hair. she has 2 to 3 bunches of cotton in her hair at any time. i try and correct her about not doing this action but by the end of the day there are 100 bunches of cotton all over the rug. we try to keep her dressed, but she takes off her clothes, or shed just find a blanket and use that for the little bits of cotton. like i said she is very active and probably gets more time out than her triple sisters but i am concerned with this behavior is a bit odd.
2059,my 7 year old recently made a comment to his neighbors (boys) suggesting that they pull the underwear down of another 4 or old girl neighbor and to sank her bottom. then soon after this comment was made, he was at her home and the girls mother found him in her closet with his parts down, alone. she told me that her daughter told her that my son pulls her in bushes. i have also been told that he explained to other children that the way you have sex is to be naked and to lay on top of one another and to kiss.i am very concerned. i know that we have caught him watching inappropriate sexual scenes on cable to that we immediately blocked. he has also experimented with tying on the internet search words such as butt or boots, etc. i am so embarrassed and scared. i worry that what he is doing is a problem and i do not know how to ease the thoughts from his mind. i also am worried about how his self esteem will be effected by the fact that my neighbors have told him he is not allowed to play with their children or come in their yard or home. i almost want to move away. what can i do to help him correct this issue and help him with the rejection he is getting as a result of his behavior?
2060,my 6 year old daughter started shaking her head about a month ago, like she was getting the hair out of her eyes.    we took her to get a haircut but that didn stop the shaking.    she says that she knows she is doing it but canst help it and i believe her as she still does it right before sleep as well.    she also has a little hum that goes along with it.    when asked if something is bothering her, she says that she misses me now that school has started but school is not new to her as she is in first grade.    what could this be?     we started her on amoxicillin because one doctor told us that it could be due to an untreated step infection.    she has only been on the meditation for a couple of days so were waiting to see if it helps.    any ideas?
2061,my son, turning 7 in feb., has angry, know-it-all, respect issues. he is a loving, sweet boy at heart but when he doesn get his way or is disciplined, he panics and then he gets so angry!when he learns about a new topic (school, sports, games, anything), he thinks hers an    expert immediately, becomes belligerent, and doesn want to be taught anymore about it. he talks in class so he misses instructions and blame other kiss for distracting him. he talks over top of us, does not want to wait his turn to talk, yells to make his point and is convinced he is right about things he has little knowledge.have seen so many children that take the word of their parents as the word of god! not mine.he always knows better and second guesses what adults tell him. he lays blame on others and seems to think that when things dont go his way, or if hers disciplined, it is someone else fault (in: well if you wouldn have done..., i wouldn have to act like... or ism being mean because you wont let me...). it just wont blow over and he over reacts practically even if its just a matter of brushing his teeth, or turning the to off to practice his reading or do some other activity.even when he was amos. old, if we stopped him from doing something he wanted to do (in: climbing things, playing w/ things he shouldn), he would just freak out.hers very smart, good at path, loving, and he even says that he wants to behave. he confessed to me that it is very difficult for him not to react the ways he does.can anyone help???

2080,guns, the 12 year old girl who was rolling around the child behavior forum is back. she has been mainly posting in the maternal/child forum. she makes up stories to get peoples sympathy and when she gets found out, she disappears for awhile only to show up again under a different surname. so far we know sheds used at least 4 different surnames. they aredogluver123212rkbkmommyof10and the latest is #5onthewayyou might recognize that she wrote a post here about her 12 year old needing glasses. sheds the 12 year old! she also made up a big story on the maternal forum about her 23 year old son falling downstairs and becoming paralyzed. she had us going for a day or two but her story kept getting more bizarre. you can read it at the maternal forum title prayers needed.ism just letting everyone know because she keeps coming back using a different surname. i want everyone to be aware and watchful. sheds actually given out dangerous advice. laura1977 warned everyone about her too back on page 5 on this forum.i actually feel kind sorry for this kid. she keeps mentioning her brothers death. maybe something really did happen and she doesn know how to deal with it. i dont know. like i wrote to the others on the maternal forum, i just wish she didn feel the need to make up stories. if sheds needing someone to talk to, she could always go to the depression or been forum or something. its sad because her actions are just making things worse for her.who knows, though, maybe this time shell leave knowing we all are watching for her.anyway, i just wanted to let you all know so we can be watchful and aware.take care, everyone.
2081,i am definitely having my lap band removed in 10 days.    my dr. said it could stay in and never bother me after i had it emptied today but i thought why have this in me if it is not doing anything.    i am very relieved to be doing this and have a great doctor that will perform the surgery.    it is interesting in that all of my friends seem very relieved that i am taking the lap band out.    .    i did not have any problems per say with the band, just acid reflux and no weight loss in 2 years which was partly my fault.    i fluctuated between a 4-6 lb. weight loss over 2 years.    has anyone had this done for the same reasons and were there complications after the surgery?

2087,our son is almost 6 years old. he stopped seeing in bed when he was little. we are wondering if something is not right. he sometimes loops or see on himself especially if he is somewhere playing(playground) or watching a to show he likes or plain video games. it does not happen all the time. he might stay with no problems for weeks then when it comes back he does it over and over again. most of the time is just a smear on his underwear. we have been forced to throw a lot of his underwears. he claims he does not know when its coming out although we doubt that. he does not see or poor in bed. he cry when we ask him if he thinks he need to wear papers. he is a very very active boy and plays a lot.is he just lazy or don`t want to stop what he is doing to us the restroom? is this normal or we need to get him some help? please help.
2088,i am at the end of my rope with my daughter. she is six years old and in the first grade. she is described (by teachers, doctors, etc) as a bright, sweet girl but . . .she is prone to these temper antrum/rages. if she doesn get what she wants, if she hears a no, if she has to wait on something, if she gets frustrated, if she is not the center of attention the water works start. the tears and crying are mild in comparison to the angry, excavating reactions. for example, when the teacher did not call on her, she got upset, kicked her desk, pushed it away, yelled out, screamed and cried and eventually hurt herself by failing before the teacher could get to her and get her out of the classroom.another time, she was in cool down in the halfway because she was already upset and crying and she got angry and threw her eyeglasses and stopped her feet.at home, she will throw toys, clothes, stop feet, beat the walls and scream that i hate you, to her father and i.since school has started, she has been taken out of class and put in cool out in the principals office three times. school has been in session for three weeks, and the three visits to cool out were within a span of five days.she is told the rules before hand, and when she breaks them, it is explained what she did wrong and she acknowledges it. (i yelled at daddy. that want nice.) however, when she is punished (sent to bed, privileges revoked) she will instantly not accept the blame. instead it becomes my fault, my husbands fault, the teachers fault, anyone fault but hers. and we are doing it not because she did something wrong, but because your mean and you dont love me.these attacks are not infrequent. they happen regularly at least every other day. my husband and i dont know what to do. we recently moved and she started a new school, but she had these problems before the move and school change, however, so i dont believe that is all of her problem.are there any suggestions to help us? we have an appointment schedule for a psychologist but that two weeks out. could there be something medical that i could ask her family physician to look at? am i missing anything or are there other details and information i should be gathering to give to her psychologist when we go?
2089,my son is 11, almost 12, and he always has a bad temper, always frustrated with everything. he is controlling towards me, and he wont take no for an answer. i am a single mother, and i feel overwhelmed all the time with his behaviour. at school he is quiet, the contrary of what he is at home. dont know what to do with him.he wants things always done his way. he just wants to play, and wont concentrate on important things.he also gets violent.what should i do?

2091,i hope someone can send me in the right direction or help.    my daughter just turned 2.    i have taken her to all her normal doctors check-up with only one concern over the 2 years and that was that she never slept through the night.    we have kept a close eye on her progression because her sister is on the cutis spectrum.    she is hitting all milestones and seems to be pretty on track with everything other than her behavior.    we brought her to the pediatrician because she was having screaming fits since about a year old.    she doesn seem to have the normal temper antrum and eventually calm down-this goes on for hours, and happens about 3-6 times a day.    i know she is two, but everyone who sees her behavior thinks this is not normal.    i dont know what to do, the doctor seems to think there is nothing wrong with her.    is this normal???    i am ready to pull my hair out because i do not know if there is something wrong and i should be helping or if she is just one of those kiss and i have my hands full with behavior.    if anyone can suggest what i should do next or where to turn to, i would greatly appreciate it.
2092,i hurt for my teenage son.    he is 17 years old and he will tell you i know ism not an average guy.    for his entire academic and social life, my son has been troubled with gullies and lacking in true friends.    my son has been diagnosed with high sanctioning spenser  s a few year ago with the most evident symptom being his lack of appropriate social skill.    his lack of social skill easily has made him a target as other children see him as odd and annoying.    he has always had to eat lunch alone and has often been made to move from a table by other kiss.    no one ever calls or asks him to come over.    it breaks my heart for him.    have intervened on many specific occasions of building with the schools support, but these intervention have not nor ever could totally shelter my son from his loneliness.    the cumulative result of all the years came to a head last spring.    with the stress of school (he does have an rep) and the obvious daily battle of enduring another day of loneliness....he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.    he began to journal his feelings (very healthy i think); however he began having conversations about his feelings with imaginary friends in his journal.    when asked by our physician, our son informs us that he knows they are imaginary.    over the summer, our son discovered the internet and forms.    although his opinions often open him up for saber building, he has found some friends online.    he began to want to dress in all black clothes and refuses to wear anything else.    he told us prior to the beginning of this school year, that if they dont get me, they dont get me!    i guess this is a healthy attitude to have, but it breaks my heart.    all his teachers say he is doing fantastic this year, but i canst tell you how sad i am for him. he said the other day that he feels like he has to hang around the both despite disagreeing with them on some moral issues, because, if i reject them, ill have no one.    bless his heart.    he says he still has his imaginary friends and even draws pictures of them.    his doctor tells me that he is just being creative...but it does concern me.    i believe that he is so lonely that he has had to create his own circle of friends...even if they dont really exist.    this grieved me so much!    how can i help?    ism his mother and we are very close...thank goodness.    he is going away to a very small community college next fall........i pray he finds a least one other person that accepts him and does not judge him for being a little different. he is a good boy!    never gets in trouble at school!!    someone told me that college may be different for my son.....as the trivial high school antics are not so easily accepted or tolerated....i pray this is true.    he has a strong christian faith.......ism so glad he has his faith.    please help us, help our son......to feel worthy, to feel an important part of this planet!    how can i help prepare him for college!    guidance please!!mon to a lonely boy!
2093,our daughter is 10 years old.    she has add and also been diagnosed with odd.    she has been taking meditation for add since st grade and is now in th.    she has always been very strong willed and tends to not go with the flow, either with parents or friends. this year has been revolving to a place that is too much for the household to sustain.we have tried many different behavior technique to try to work through things but to no avail.    her hatred for school, her family, her tennis lessons....etc is off the charts.    she says the most harmful and mean things one human can say to another when she is being presented with something that she does not want to do.    we used to get mad back and fly off the handle and lately we have tried staying as calm as possible and give her choice that she can make....actually seems to be getting worse though.it is breaking our hearts that our little girl has turned on us at 10 years old for no apparent reason.i will add that when she is playing with her friends she is happy as can be.    she lives for that.    she will be all smiles and happy with all of us if she can have a friend with her.    anything that cuts into that play time, she rates with a vengeance.this discussion is related hateful daughter.
2094,i have a five year old boy. when he was younger we had an incident and reported it to the police. he was 2.5 years old when his uncle, who was 8 at the time and was sexual abuse by his mother, was touching and looking at each others privates. i called the police and hold a lot of resentment about the situation. everyone around me said it was normal child behavior, but i worried it was more. the uncle was badly abused and at the time had the mental capacity of a 5 or 6 year old from the abuse. now my son is 5 and is showing what i think are signs of the abuse and everyone around me is again telling me boys will be boys. he as now gotten to where he is pulling his parts down in a room with 3 other kiss his age. i am worrying that i missed some signs by listening to everyone around me. i really hope i did not fail my son, but besides these behavior problems he seems to be a happy little boy. he says he does not want to go to school about every other day. he plays well with other children and is my only child. he loves attention, but believes he is getting to big to give his mon huge and kisses. should i worry or should i relax and let kiss be kiss?

2098,i was wondering if you could assist me or lead me to someone who can?    ism searching for a case in which to carry my story supplies.    the one i have now is pretty old and will need to be replaced.    unfortunately, the only id that on it is made in china.    its a final case 8 long x wide & 4 deep.     when you until it,it opens up to reveal 3 sections with pockets to put supplies.    it also has a slippered pocket and a regular pocket on the outside. also, on the outside, there is a large hook on one end and a handle on the other.    i canst believe they dont still make something comparable to this for estimates who travel, etc.    so far, have had no luck finding it or something comparable.    hope someone out there can help.
2099,my daughter is going to be two in november. she has developed a habit of wanting to be in her room. she has a to, ver, movie, toys, and is allowed to do anything she wants in there without punishment (prettymuch).    she will often come out to play or see what everyone doing stay out for 40 min or so and go back to her room for about an hour. she also goes to her room if she doesn get what she wants, or gets in trouble told no act.. we have her on a schedule where she gets up, caps, and goes to bed which she candles fine. however, she really does spend a lot of time in her room. my mon is driving me nuts telling me there something wrong, and ism not around all day long so i dont see it (i have school and work full time). is my daughter starting an antisocial habit i should worry about or just getting comfortable with having her on space to be free in?

2101,my kid who just turned 3 in march can count to 20, knows alphabet, shapes, colors and is very interested in books. he asks to go friends house but when they come he very very little peer interaction. its the same thing in school. we did access him and they told they dont think of any problem. he talks a lot at home to me and his dad. he understands everything we say and he asks for things. so is this no peer interaction an issue? note english is his second language and he has been staying home full time till 7 months back, then he started going to preschool. he has no behavior issues. he is a very gentle, soft kid. but just little peer interaction
2102,my daughter has always had a problem wetting her parts.    have had all the test run and there is nothing medical going on.    with in the last year have gotten it under control at home but she still seems to be wetting her parts at her fathers every other weekend.have told him all the ways to handle it but he wont take my advise, he chooses to punish her.    she was at her fathers last weekend and he didn take her to dance class because he said she passed her parts and then lied to him about it.    she stayed the night with her step-mothers mon and had an accident over there while sleeping and her father made her apologize to the grandmother for seeing on her couch.... ism at a loss on what to do and almost to the point of not letting her go over there any longer...just wondering if there was anything else i could try before resorting to that because when she comes home from her fathers house she always seems so defeated and down on herself which isn healthy

2104,my 2 youngest children are 12 (boy) and 14(girl). i used to share custody with my ex,    but my kiss would call me all the time needing basic comforting that their father refused to provide. i would even read them books over the phone to help them fall to sleep. when they wouldcome to my house,my daughter would often sleep with me, needing the comfort and i figured she would outgrowth it when she was ready, and she did,one year ago. recently, my eyes physical and emotional abuse of my children got out of hand, and long story short, i now have primary custody. during these last 4 months of emotional upheaval, my 12 year old son wants to sleep with me all the time. its a king sized bed, and there is certainly nothing inappropriate going on. have asked him why he wants to always sleep in my bed, and he says because it feels so comfortable. ( his father punched him in the ribs repeatedly and told him he was nothing but a lazy fat slow.) ism thinking he will outgrowth this, as his sister did, but am i doing something wrong; am i hurting him somehow?

2108,my four year old has enlarged lymph nodes and is acting completely out of control (screaming, being rude to strangers, saying she rates everyone, etc).    the doctor can find nothing wrong with her other than the enlarged lymph nodes (in her neck).    he says it is probably some kind of virus.    she occasionally complains of ear aches but then will say they do not hurt anymore.    can her behavior be linked to the lymph nodes?

2114,my son has some behavior issues and we are seeking help through a psychologist.    we recently met with a doctor.    he told us that he would like to have permission to keep our sons secrets from us, even though by law we are entitled to know everything our son tells him.    we have never had any counselling experience, so i wanted to know if this is a normal request.    i am not comfortable with this.    i do not think it is prudent to give permission to another adult to keep secrets from a parent, nor do i want to set the precedent with my son to do this.thank you.

2119,my 4 or old son got kicked out of his daycare about 2 weeks ago for bad behavior.    they just plain gave up on helping us.    now he is in a new one in the next town because we only had one in the small town we live in.    hers had a hard time adjusting to the new one.    i talked to his teacher when he started and told her everything that went on at the other one so they would know what is going on.    he would have a antrum and then throw chairs or toys and time out never worked.    now at the new one he would do really good for about 3 days and then have a bad day to where he would pitch a fit which lead to throwing chairs, etc.    he been there for 12 days and has had 3 bad days.    he had a bad day friday and now they dont know if hers allowed back on monday.    i have talked to our pediatrician several times about his behavior and i finally asked her to recommend an adolescent counselor which we are going to this week.    he only acts like this at school and not at home.    i dont know why he thinks he can get away with it there, we talk to him all the time about listening to his teachers and doing what they ask him to do.    it seems that they are giving up on us too.    we are doing our best to try and help our son but we canst find a daycare who is willing to work with us.    he starts pre next year and we dont want this behavior there too.

2122,in a sum with 4 children i have a 8 year old girl she is really naughty she lies,horrible to others antrum, swears. i have tried everything but nothing seems to work i know what i need is help what do i do.
2123,hi there,my 27 month old son is happy, out-going, social and very active who sleeps well, can be a little fussy with food, and has antrum maybe once a day on average -- so nothing out of the ordinary, i believe. i am at home full time with him and his 8 month old brother so he has never been in any kind of day care.my concern is that he shows no interest in sitting down and concentrating on the types of activities i keep reading that other tollers enjoy, and i wonder whether he is already showing signs of some kind of add or attention-related problems. he will not do puzzled, play with blocks, spend much time with shape porters, or draw or paint, or anything similar. he does like to look at books, and play with cars / planes / trains, but usually not for very long. he tends to cruise continuously and just sample things briefly. he has been seen by an occupational therapist who tried to engage him in activities so she could lengthen his concentration, but he just wanted to run around the room and look at things. she suggested i try to get him to focus on just one toy at a time and sit with him and keep him at a single activity for as long as possible, ideally for at least half an hour a day. i have tried presenting lots of activities to him and this has been tough, especially as i am often forced to get up and leave him to attend to the 8 month old. to keep him at an activity simple persuasion usually doesn work, only physical restraint which really defeats the purpose.i just try to get out of the house as often as possible to playgroup and the park, but in order to get myself ready to leave i usually put his favourite show on the to for an hour or so in the morning, and i also use to at night so i can bath, feed and put the baby to bed without interruption. i am also worried that this is a time bomb waiting to go off, and that i could be worsening any add tendencies that he might have for the future.i have bought a few books about toller activities but am i worrying too much? does his day really have to be filled with structures activities that require my participation the whole time? how can i teach/encourage him to play by himself some of the time?i have started to doubt my ability to provide the right stimulation and have considered day care earlier than i would prefer, although he has severe food galleries and eczema making us nervous about sending him to day care.ind really appreciate your thoughts.
2124,i delivered my baby girl at 18 weeks.. a week before her delivery everything was fine, i went for a scan and they found so many problems with her it was just not possible for her to survive! she was born on the with of december 2009 , she had a hope-plastic left heart, cystic hygroma, bright bowel and her chambers in her heart had it formed properly .she also had turner-syndrome..i found out i was pregnant again on the 28 th of sept after etc for 7 month today i found out the pregnancy sac is empty and i have to go for a surgical evacuation on thursday . i just can believe lightning would strike twice why me? i have a healthy 3 year old boy who keeps me going and a very suppurative husband.
2125,my son pick on his face (it used to be around his finger nails before) when he has nothing to do in. in the car or at night when in reading a book.    i noticed some anxiety when he does it.    he gets a few tiny pimples from it that go away he next day.    once or twice he has picked on a cut that he created.    if i give him a lot of attention and affection he relaxes and stops. by a lot i mean if i hug him through out the day a lot and treat him like a little baby then he starts saying guns gage and he is happy.    why?    i have 2 tollers and i dont have enough free time to do that, what can i do?

2127,we have an 11 year old boy that is wonderful!    he is very intelligent, has a great group of friends, and does well in sporting activities.    however, over the past year until now, he will cry when he doesn do well at a sporting event.    even if he makes 10 baskets in a row at a game, then misses the next one, he will start to cry.    he also does this on the baseball field.    we have tried everything and do not put any pressure on him, it is the pressure he puts on himself to be perfect.    he does not act like this in school or anywhere else, just on the playing field.    any suggestions as to what we can do to help him control these emotions? thanks!
2128,vitamin d: a weapon against breast cancer your a woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, all the more reason to have your vitamin-d level checked: research suggests a link between low levels and recurrence of, or death from, the cancer. evidently, low levels of vitamin d are quite common in women diagnosed with breast cancer.naturally, mainstream researches are quick to back-pedal away from making a recommendation of taking more vitamin d supplement. some doctors would actually rather give you them than supplement  i guess there reluctant to take money out of big pharma's pockets.research has already noted a link between the risk of breast cancer and levels of vitamin d. but researches are a nervous wreck over recommending getting too much vitamin d.but before they worry about too much, how about rousing on getting your vitamin d levels just right? sure, you can always over a good thing, but the point is to know where you are today.have been talking about the importance of vitamin d for years, back before it became trend to even think about. i check my patients 25-hydrops vitamin d level. levels below 20 monograms per milliliter (no/my) are deficient, 20 to 30 bordering, and 30 to 50 healthy. i have sent breast-cancer patients of mine to an eminent integration oncologist in new york city. he liked to keep his patients vitamin-d levels between 50 and 60 no/my. based on the available evidence, this seems both reasonable and safe, specifically for higher risk patients with a family history of breast cancer, who have had breast cancer themselves, or who are currently being treated for breast cancer.you'll want to work closely with your doctor to get your level back up in the healthy range, which may mean multiple tests to gauge your progress. be patient, but be diligent.dr.i

2130,my son is 4 1/2 years old and is one of the sweetest boys you'll ever meet (most of the time)....however he can turn it off like a switch.    i want to be able to enjoy him the way i always dreamed of when i had children.    i find myself raising my voice more often than not...and yes, spanning his behind....more to get his attention....i realize that spanning to some, is not an effective solution. but sometimes i feel that it is the only way to stop him in his tracks.the last two days, he has ran off from me despite telling him to come back...or please stay away from the road, so you can be safe..etc....he looks at me with these devilish grin, and just keeps going.    its all i can do to contain myself without screaming at the top of my lungs.    he does this running off thing quite often...and i dont know how to get it through to him that this is not appropriate behavior.    for instance, i got a hold of him yesterday, wanted his butt,and took him straight to his room......removed his to...and explained to him why i was doing that..(you ran away, you could have been hurt..etc)......he says he understands....but the next day he does it again....and again....i feel like ism consistent with discipline, but i feel that there has to be something else i can try.    above all, i love my boys (3 year old also)0...and i hate yelling....they certainly know how to push my buttons.my boys recently started daycare/preschool...and on friday i got a report that my 4 year old was acting up.    i just want my kiss to be respectful and productive members of society.......help?!?ism just not satisfied that they will grow out of it......i see a lot of    other kiss that are their ages, who do not behave in these ways...i realize that it is behavior modification on the parents part and the child part...i need help...i would like to establish solid discipline before this becomes a huge problem....

2145,hello- new topic for me- my neighbors have a 4 or old boy whom i babysit and see while visiting (ism friends w/ the mon) the little boy is very smart, but yet, his behavior is unbelievable. he is in total control of his mother, and what i have seemed to noticed, he does not like his mon to pay attention to anyone else but him. if we are talking in the kitchen, he has to be right there in the middle of us, while there are other kiss, the dad in the living room... while i ask him to let his mummy have adult time, he will start screaming and crying at the top of his lungs, he will throw things, use the f word. he will get so upset, he will literally fall to the ground like a 2 or old having a temper antrum. he always wants to do what the adults are doing (i know kiss are curious) but, it gets to the point where he hurts himself. his mon was cooking and he wanted to lip the eggs like mon. mon kept telling him to get away from the stove because the stove is hot, and he could get hurt. he looked right at her then stuck his hand right on the tip of the pan. he will not listen, ever- when i babysit, i set rules. example, when we were outside, i said he couldn leave the yard. he looked at me and ran right down the side walk. when i went to get him, he tells me he in rates me, then the temper antrum comes. the mon also has a 2 or old who does the same. she actually had a nervous breakdown and spent 5 days on the such floor. the father is never home, but the mother never ever grounds, gives him time out. there is no winning, reasoning w/ this child. you can be nice as nice, give him the 3 second count, and he will not listen. i stopped babysitting, but when i still visit- its total caps. stopped visiting, but when i call, we can talk cause the kiss are screaming so loud we canst hear each other. i tried to give the mon advice, but she doesn listen and just gives him his way, no matter what. when they were leaving the other day, she stopped real quick, i was standing outside her car while she was asking me something, and the 4 or old kept screaming, mummy! go! i want to go! and because she was talking real quick, he took his chocolate milk and just dropped it to splitter everywhere... (which she wouldn let him have, but he won) is this normal? my daughter didn act like this, all kiss are different, though. is it the parents? what would be the best advice to give her w/ out offending her printing skill... ism telling a, this would be the biggest show for the nancy- i have never, ever seen a four year old act like this... ever-    thank you.
2146,i am a school psychologist and am currently possessing a    3 1/2 year old student who suffers from significant constipation. the doctors he is seeing are relating the disorder to control. the assessment is revealing that although he has intact speech and language skill he does not use his speech often....he is very quiet. cutis has been ruled out. he is also extremely moody and often antrum. my gut tells me that much of his behavior can be connected to the constipation due to the fact that he most likely doesn feel good. my question is if anyone knows of the behavior implication for children who suffer from significant constipation.
2147,i am in a three year relationship with a man the has went from a twelve pack of regular beer to a case or more of ice beer a day. he has not seen his young children much in the three years. both his parents died from cancer four years ago within six months of each other. i have talked to him, tried to get him to get help. he has been drinking for 25 years and i believe he has cirrhosis of the liver. it has seriously affected our relationship and i cry clot. i want to help him but it seems he does not want to change. i feel like i am slowly watching the man i love kill himself and i do not know what to do. he is now making me feel like i wish i could just die myself because he is harmful to me mentally yet i can not seem to leave him. please help me, i do not want to watch him kill himself yet i love him so much i do not want to be without him. what option can i try?

2149,for 17 yes my mother took care of her colostomy, but now she has developed dementia and can no longer care for herself. she uses a 2 piece colostomy, with a water and a bag, and has always used stomahesive powder, but everytime i change it for her now it leads, do you need to let the stomahesive powder set up for 15 minutes by you add the water? or add the water and let it set up like that for 15 minutes.? mon was always a very private person and never saw the need for me to learn how to change her colostomy. thanks for the help.
2150,my 3 1/2 year old was born with a cleft in his soft palate which was repaired successfully at one year. he is still not talking well and many people except for myself, grandparents, aunt etc find it difficult to understand what he is saying. he has started school and the teacher has complained about his behavior. he sucks his forefinger (this started soon after i stopped his bottle last july), takes his shoes and socks off in class (we do this at home or when entering another persons home), suddenly gets up and wanders off when the teacher is teaching, shows difficulty in writing and understanding what she says. she says that he is immature for a child his age and candles her breast and wants to be carried sometimes. he used a pacifier for the st year and we had to discontinue it after the repair. that was when he started touching my breast for comfort. i have told him not to do it and he hardly does it now. he started speech therapy 2 weeks ago and has improved already. but because of his lack of coherent speech his classmates do not understand him so he has no best friend as such but he does play football and run around with them. the school counsellor says that he might be artistic because of this. i think that an unfair diagnosis because of his cleft palate. he knows his colours, numbers 1-50, sings, can read alphabet and match words, do puzzled well. he bubbles but also speaks in sentences of up to 4 words. when i sit with him, he writes his standing and    sleeping lines well, joins the dots, colours nicely and is constantly asking for evaluation by saying, mamma look, mamma look.    his went and pediatrician say that he appears normal and intelligent to them. he loves going to school and calls his teacher his best friend but i think that he is frustrated that people cannot understand him and behaves like that. is he artistic?
2151,why mug is so dangerousone of the best overview of the very real dangers of mug comes from dr. russell blaylock, a board-terrified neurosurgeon and author of   excitotoxins: the taste that kills.   in it he explains that mug is an excitotoxin, which means it overexcites your cells to the point of damage or death, causing brain damage to varying degrees -- and potentially even triggering or worsening learning disabilities, alzheimer  s disease, atkinson  s disease, you gehrig  s disease and more.part of the problem also is that free glutamic acid is the same neurotransmitter that your brain, nervous system, eyes, pancreas and other organs use to initiate certain processes in your body.[4] even the da states:  studies have shown that the body uses glutamate, an among acid, as a nerve impulse transmitted in the brain and that there are glutamate-responsive tissues in other parts of the body, as well.abnormal function of glutamate receptor has been linked with certain neurological diseases, such as alzheimer's disease and huntington chorea. injections of glutamate in laboratory animals have resulted in damage to nerve cells in the brain.  [5]although the da continues to claim that consuming mug in food does not cause these ill effects, many other experts say otherwise.according to dr. blaylock, numerous glutamate receptor have been found both within your hearts electrical condition system and the heart muscle itself. this can be damaging to your heart, and may even explain the sudden deaths sometimes seen among young athletes.he says:  when an excess of food-borne excitotoxins, such as mug, hydrolyzed protein so protein isolate and concentrate, natural favoring, sodium fascinate and aspartate from aspartame, are consumed, these glutamate receptor are over-stimulated, producing cardiac arrhythmias.when magnesium stores are low, as we see in athletes, the glutamate receptor are so sensitive that even low levels of these excitotoxins can result in cardiac arrhythmias and death.  [6]many other adverse effects have also been linked to regular consumption of mug, including:obesityeye damageheadachesfatigue and disorientationdepressionfurther, even the da admits that   short-term reactions   known as mug symptom complex can occur in certain groups of people, namely those who have eaten   large doses   of mug or those who have asthma.[7]according to the da, mug symptom complex can involve symptoms such as:numbnessburning sensationtinglingfacial pressure or tightnesschest pain or difficulty breathingheadachenausearapid heartbeatdrowsinessweaknessno one knows for sure just how many people may be   sensitive   to mug, but studies from the 1970s suggested that 25 percent to 30 percent of the u.s. population was intolerant of mug -- at levels then found in food. since the use of mug has expanded dramatically since that time, it  s been estimated that up to 40 percent of the population may be impacted.[8]how to determine if mug is in your woodford manufacturers are not stupid, and they  ve caught on to the fact that people like you want to avoid eating this nasty food addition. as a result, do you think they responded by removing mug from their products? well, a few may have, but most of them just tried to   clean   their labels. in other words, they tried to hide the fact that mug is an ingredient.how do they do this? by using names that you would never associate with mug.you see, it  s required by the da that food manufacturers list the ingredient   monosodium glutamate   on food labels, but they do not have to label ingredient that contain free glutamic acid, even though it  s the main component of mug.there are over 40 labelled ingredient that contain glutamic acid,[9] but you  d never know it just from their names alone. further, in some foods glutamic acid is formed during processing and, again, food labels give you no way of knowing for sure.tips for keeping mug out of your diet general, if a food is processes you can assume it contains mug (or one of its pseudo-ingredient). so if you stick to a whole, fresh foods diet, you can pretty much guarantee that you  ll avoid this toxin.the other place where you  ll need to watch out for mug is in restaurant. you can ask your server which menu items are mug-free, and request that no mug be added to your meal, but of course the only place where you can be entirely sure of what  s added to your food is in your own kitchen.to be on the safe side, you should also know what ingredient to watch out for on package foods. here is a list of ingredient that always contain mug:autolyzed least    calcium fascinate gelatinglutamate glutamic acid hydrolyzed proteinmonopotassium glutamate monosodium glutamate    sodium caseinatetextured protein least extract least foodyeast nutrientthese ingredient often contain mug or create mug during processing:[10]favors and favoring reasoning    natural favors and favoring    natural pork favoring natural beef flavoringnatural chicken favoring so sauce    so protein isolate    so protein    bouillonstock    both    malt extract    malt favoring    barley maltwhey protein carrageenan    maltodextrin    section    enzymesprotease    corn starch    nitric acid    powdered milk    anything protein fortifiedanything enzyme modified anything ultra-pasteurizedso if you do eat processes foods, please remember to be on the lookout for these many hidden names for mug.now......i always label read for mug, but now it brings on a whole new meaning to label reading.....maybe i need to bring a label information book!! these companies are sooooo speak about slipping it in!!
2152,i contracted clostridium difficult most likely either from an e.r. visit b/c of an ear infection, or the antibiotics used to treat it.    i was 7-1/2 the pregnant and complained for 3 weeks of diarrhoea.    no doctors listened to me.    4 weeks later, 1 week after the birth of my daughter, i was finally diagnosed upon return to the e.r. for severe abdominal pain.    i was given flag and vancomyacin and improved for 2 days or so. (i was receiving half of the do recommended dose of each)    i began to get worse after those two days and the antibiotics were never increased or changed until 24 his before being media-lighted to a hospital that want willing to just let me die.    upon arrival, i was told if my entire colon was not removed that night, i would be dead before any antibiotics would take affect.    my body was so infected and sick, they removed 5 liners of fluid off my abdomen(abdomen)(2 liners were removed at the first hospital, as they thought at first it was my appendix)    i spent 5 days in ice and another week and a half recovering in the hospital.my actual question:    had the first hospital increased my dosage of flag and vancomyacin when i first showed signs of relapse (or just worsening) or tried some other antibiotic, could the severity of my illness, and ultimately my total colostomy possibly have been avoided?
2153,my step son has lived with his mother and her grandparents since he was 3 months old.    he and his mother not only share a room, but the bed.    at our house, he has his own room, space, and big boy bed.we have determined that my step son has two different personalities in each home.    at our home, my husband and i also have a 5 month old.    my step son adores him and helps out.    he helps me with the sundry, dishes, and sometimes cooking food.    hers involved a lot.    however, he does not like to be in a room by himself.    for example, if we are all outside and he has to petty, he will not come inside to go with out one of us.    he is very polite and well behaved. at his comes residents its a totally different story.    he has told us that he will play and see himself, because he doesn want to stop what hers doing.    he told us that he has a see basket where he puts his wet clothes. his mother tells us that he is completely disrespectful to her, and her grandparents.    he throws temper antrum if he doesn get his way. they do not interact with him, they just put him in front of the to, because its easier. he has spit, and thrown toys at his mother. his mother took him to a psychologist and the doctor told us and the mother that my step son would be better living with us and his mother having position. once the doctor told her that, she removed him from therapy.    sometimes he stares off into space, and ignores when someone is speaking to him.    just 2 weeks ago the mother told my husband that their son told her mummy one day you are going to be under water    maybe ill want you dead    we are really concerned where this is coming from.    yesterday at school, he got mad at another student and said will shoot you in your tummy'what should we do?    we have tried to remove him from that home.    the courts told her to get her own place, and she has a section 8 apartment, but refuses to live there.    we have fought twice for custody and both times we did not get my step son. the judge said she did not have enough material changes for her to remove him from that home.what should we do?    we are really concerned for his well being and mentality. please help

2157,i have a 5 or old boy that recently started kindergarten.    he was in daycare all his life, pre-school etc.    kindergarten has been a little hard for him sometimes behaving.    not daily or anything like that, my wife and i have not really been tolerant to the notes home.anyway, yesterday at the store he told his mon that he heard a voice telling him that his mother was stupid.    this really upset her.    he told her it kept saying it.    then on the way out to the car i heard him whisper my mon isn stupid.    now i dont know if he was saying that to appease his upset mother or what.    not really observing what happened i looked him dead in the face and told him to knock it off.    i asked him right after tucking him in if he still heard the voice and he said no but started asking questions.    he an advanced kid, talked early and all that stuff.    his story telling and imagination is very advanced, always was.    he can talk his way out of a lot.    he not a badly behaved kid and liked by all his friends, teachers etc.    anyway, during the ride home he said he hears talking in his head a lot.    i asked him if it was his voice and he said yes.later that night when i had him alone.    i asked him if he heard it in his head and just said it out loud and explained to him about thoughts and your own voice.    i talk to myself a lot.    so does my father.    i mean in our head not out loud.    i am the kind of person that constantly problem solved in my head.    he also an very concerned kid, thinks and asks about everything.    anyway, he never mentioned it before.    i have to admit there is a fair amount of verbal arguing in the house.    ism sure that doesn help with all the pressure he is under.    i wonder if we just need to calm things down for him and are there other trigger that i should look out for.the only other thing he has complained about is a headache now and again when he tired.    its rare and goes away on it own.    he has amblyopia (lazy eye) in one eye and gets watched so when he is over tired can get a headache but again, we are not even talking 5 times in his life.    eye doctor says this is normal.i am thinking i have an overlay imaginative kid who is a little too analytical for his own good.    i also think maybe all the yelling in the house is stressing him.    he might have even heard me say to my wife your being stupid, who knows. i am obviously concerned and even more upset that we have done this to him indirectly.    he such a daring, loving kid.    shows a ton of affection etc.i have read about old on his board but i really haven seen any sign of that that i would know about. no issues with moods or anything either.    what do you think?
2158,my mother believes that 85% of a child personality and disposition is genetic and is responsible for how children turn out, the remaining 15% is influenced by a combination of society, scholastic and parental influences.    i am stunned.    i believe that the primary influence is parental, despite individual personality inclination.    please weigh on this.

2160,for 6 years my daughter has been asking for a baby sister. well, after 5 years of trying and tons of heart break we have achieved this. i am now 18 weeks pregnant and found out 2 days ago it is indeed a girl. since then my daughter has been very distant and uninterested in anything to do w/ the baby. yesterday i went out and bought a bunch of stuff for the baby and when i got home i was all excited and showing my kiss (i have a 14 or old son as well) when my daughter told me all i care about is the baby. i could not believe what i was hearing. i had to really push to get her to tell me what was going on. then she broke down crying and told me she is afraid her stepped wont love her anymore because now he will have a real daughter. (my husband has been the only father she has ever known and her big dad is no where in the picture.) i told her that was not true and that his love for her would never change. she said we were replacing her w/ the baby and that he would no longer have time for her. i explained that baby do take clot of time and attention, but that we were hoping she would be there to help as well. i explained we want her very involved and that her relationship w/ this baby was going to be very important. being 15 years older and the big his, trinity (the baby) would probably be coming to her for things she doesn feel she can come to us about. she just told me she want going to be around. she was sobbing and i could tell she was very upset. sheds 15 and i never thought we would have this issue at this age. i dont know what else to say to convince her that we will always love her very much and nothing will ever take that away. i asked my husband to talk to her, but ism not even sure if that will help since i couldn get through to her. does anyone have any suggestions what we can do????
2161,has anyone worked with national ultrasound, in., or medcorp to purchase equipment? just wanted to know if they are reputable to deal with.    thanks
2162,i am looking for some ways to , on schedule    basis, track my 16 years old is, making sure hers in school and hers in where he says he is. i know there mobile software out there that can spy the location but that not what i want to do. i am looking for a more preventive measure instead. i want to be able to make sure he goes to school, or be at home by cure when i work out of town. meanwhile, i want to respect his privacy and give him some room during the freedom time.i am a busy single parent and i dont have time to monitor him 24/7. is there any software that helps me to monitor my boy? once again, i want to give him some degree of freedom and start treating him like an adult. but it is unacceptable that he just makes stay out late while i am out of the states for work..
2163,for the last 2 and half to 3 years my daughter, who is now 9 has had issues with having accidents. she has several accidents a day with by. it started around the time i got pregnant with my youngest, so we just assumed it was due to trying to deal with that, but it just kept continuing. now years later, we have tried everything. we have taken her to a family doctor who ran a few tests (for parasites, blood in her by, etc.) when nothing came of that he recommended a pediatric gasternologist (he is suppose to be the best here in tucson). we went to see him, followed his order to a t and tried to help her as much as possible. last month he said that he doesn need to see her because she is doing much better. which is not the case at all, and i let him know how i felt. i have yet to see any improvement. we done everything he has said, enema, laxitives, stool softness, finer, diet. i have to admit, my husband does get frustrated at times, my husband tells her a lot to stop being so lazy. i dont know if that really the case at all or if she truly can feel the urge. i was confiding to a close friend about this and she said it sounds like she could have something called encopresis. i have researches it a little and feel that is a good possibility. i asked our family doctor about it, and he referred me to the same doctor. its just a continuous circle with no hope in sight. i dont know what else to do. sometimes i feel so sorry for my daughter because this canst be easy for her. she has accidents at school, and she smells bad. we send extra clothes and have talked to her principal and teacher. my fear is that it will never end and what kind of life will my daughter have. please if you know where i can get help for my daughter, let me know.

2168,any kiss do anything similar to this? my 3 or loves bellies. he has always done this. if he sees someone belly he wants to touch it. we have been at the mall and hell see a girl wearing a short shirt and will go and lift her shirt to see her belly. another example is my sir used to think it was cut that he wanted to see her belly and feel how soft it was. so she let him see and touch. now he wont leave her alone. everytime she comes over as soon as she sits down hell ask her to see her belly. when he was younger everyone thought it was a cut thing to do so family and friends would show their bellies to him. but when i started to noticed that he wanted to do it to everyone where ever we went i started to tell him not to. usually hell stop, but every so often in ll see him trying to look a someone belly. like we were at a plowland and i heard him asking a 3 or of girl can i see your belly. she thought he was funny. i went and told him not and he didn do it again. .i have asked his teacher about it at school and she said she hasn seen him do it. i know at first i would laugh and so would most people so maybe he thinks its something to get attention for. but i stopped thinking it was cut a long time ago. he dont do it as often but every so often he will.i know this sounds really odd. i just not sure what to think about this. i never heard of a kid doing this before. thanksbnik
2169,i have 2 children, a step-daughter that is 4 1/2 and a son that will 4 in a few weeks. our household has been intragated for the last 4 years. my step-daughters mother (further mentioned as mon)wanted nothing to do with her after she found out what a pain (her words) having a child was and forfeited sole custody to myself and my (now) husband. so all her life she had grown up with me as mummy. that is until about a year ago. mon ran into me and my daughter out at the market. my daughter didn know who she was so she paid no mind to her, i on the other hand knew exactly who she was and was waiting for a comment. which i received. mon walked over to us looked at my daughter and said aunt you going to say hi to your mummy? my daughter, very confused at this point, look at me and said who is she? mon proceeded to throw a fit very passed off that my daughter didn know who who real mother was. i immediately left the store. i spoke with my husband about the issue and suggested we go to family court now to put everything into writing. which we are attempting to do at this point. fast forward to now.the judge as recent as june decided that every weekend visits with mon were nessassary to rebuild mon and daughters relationship. (against our better judgement we have to let her go) out of the last 15 weeks she has seen her 7 times. mon recently had a new baby and is couch jumping if you will. we recently returned to court requesting supervised visits, no overnight, and child protective services to investigate. our request was granted.mon called to speak to my husband at least 15 times a day, in which he doesn answer. when our daughter gets home from daycare, we allow her to call mon, on speaker phone to say hello. we noticed that mon was trilling her for answers and when our daughter would as a simple question such as what are you doing? mon would reply with tell your father its none of his ******* business, how about that?! i have several times advised her to stop using inappropriate words while on the phone with her and have hung up on her many times b/c of her language. that was as recent as last night.here my issue:this morning my daughter approached me and said mummy? do i have to call gloria mummy and you by your name? i told her she could call us whatever she felt comfortable with. that ossified her for about 2 minutes then she said how come god made her my mummy too? she so mean all the time. i thought mommy's are supposed to be nice and love us? and before i could answer she continued with how come mummy-gloria didn want me as a baby and gave me to you and daddy? i didn know what to say. i told her we would talk about it after school. well, school is almost over and i know for sure she is going to re-ask the question......what do i say? do i lie to protect her? to i tell the truth? i am not even sure i know the answer... any suggestions!?
2170,my son has been in a daycare center since he was 2 1/2 yes old, with a very structures classroom and did great there.    he went to a private kindergarten in a church that only had preschool and 1 kindergarten class, and only 11 students in his class, and he did great there also.    this year, i open enrolled him into a school that had very high rating (the district we live in is really bad).    a week into the school year, he was sent home for his behavior and started acting up at home and church also.    when i was trying to figure out what was wrong (it was obvious that something was bothering him), he didn know, but then told me he sometimes thinks about killing himself.    there was a suicide early this year that i was not able to keep him from knowing about, so i think he got the idea from that.    i called his pediatrician for a referral- was told i had to bring him to children er, so i did.    at the hospital, we each talked with a social worker who said that when kiss his age say that, it is usually because they feel like it would be easier if they weren there.    she said she saw no indication of him harming himself, and referred us to a play therapist.    he has been seeing the therapist for over a month now, and she told me on tuesday that she is not seeing any signs of any emotional problems with him.    instead, she is very impressed with what she is seeing, and said that when he tries something, he will not give up until he gets it right, and will not cheat either.    she said most kiss would either give up, or cheat and think she doesn notice, but he is determined to do his very best until he gets it.    i was very happy to hear that- but the problems at school are getting worse every day.    outside of school, it only lasted about a week, and he has been completely back to normal (or even better behaved...) at home, church, and daycare.    but nothing is working for school.    they are doing stick charts, and his evenings at home with me are dependent on his day at school.    if he had a good day, then he gets to have a fun night at home.    if not- then he has everything taken away at home and has to do something that he considers boring until it is bedtime.    he has occasional good days- but i would say 75% are bad.    just over a month into the school year, i had to leave work today for the th time to get him already.    the last 3 times, he has been so worked up when i got there, that he is throwing things and hiding under tables, and even pushing me away from him.    i canst calm him down until the principal leaves the room, and then i have to hug him to get him to relax.    there was a day last week that his whole body was bright red and he was dripping in sweat from the fighting (and fear that i could clearly see in his eyes- the school insists that the only one to be afraid of there is him).    he has been doing completely random and crazy things at school to disrupt the class, and canst handle the results of it.they had me sit through his class one day a couple weeks ago, and all the kiss were out of control, doing the things they tell me he does, while he was sitting quietly next to me.    another parent was the mystery reader the next day and said she had to stop reading at least 10 times because they were all so wild.    the current teacher is a long term sub while the regular teacher is on paternity leave, and this is her first time teaching alone.    i think a lot of his problem is the chaos in the room, and he is reacting to that.    he is a child that will react a lot to what is going on around him, and get excited and then not know when to stop- so would probably take things further than the other kiss if he gets to that point.    the school wont tell me, but i saw other kiss having a lot of the same problems as him, and he is telling me every day about someone else going to the principals office from his class (which is where he spends most of his days...).    the teacher is great, very nice, but i think too nice.    when they explain to me the things that happened, it always starts with well, we were sitting on the floor and he was rolling around and not sitting, but that want a big deal so i let it go.    i have told her many times to end it there, because if he is allowed to do that, it will only spiral from there.    but every time i still keep hearing about things that weren a big deal to start with so she just let it go.    and i am also told she canst stop the class to make him sit.    but he has learned now that no one will do anything, so why not do it?    last week they started documenting the things he was doing and suspended him for a day.    today he was suspended again for 2 days, and they had him in a room that is used for occupational therapy because they said if he throws things in there, its all soft, and they also had a video camera on him to document the behavior.    the principal sat down with me and went through 2 pages of things she wrote down (she has now been in the class all day for almost a week) and how dangerous he is to the rest of the school.    i brought him to the pediatrician, who said if it was something that needed meditation, he wouldn have done so well up until now.    she said it sounded like he needs to be in a new class or a new school.    that was 2 weeks ago, and i really didn want to do that, but today it reached a point where i dont think there is any other choice.    they are trying to expel him anyway.    the principal insists that the school does everything perfectly and the only problem is that he needs to get it into his head that he canst act like that at school.    i can guarantee- its already in his head.    he never knows why he does any of it.    but i bring him every morning in a good mood, and excited and determined to work hard and have a better day.    it just doesn last after i leave.    i have not been happy with the way the principal talks to him like he is just bad and needs to change, i can see in his face that it is only making it worse, but she doesn care what the cause of the problem is or what needs to be done to help him.    (at least not from my view- or his days or therapist...)    last week they started special ed assessment, to see if there is anything special ed could help with, even though his academic are great.    he loves school- and loves doing his homework.    but i think he is giving up now.    after the suspension last week, they started having the principal sit in his class to watch him, which i knew would not go well because it is only with her that he gets worked up and canst calm himself down.    4 days of that, and i have left work for him twice.    today she told me that he canst handle being around kiss, and that why its only at school, and has nothing to do with anything at school.    but he goes to daycare after school and is doing fine there, went to church tonight (after the horrible day with the video camera) for his wednesday night class, and they said he was great there. hers always been around other kiss and has been fine.    he says he likes all the kiss, they are all nice, and no one pick on him.    no one has hurt him or touched him or anything (that he will admit, but he is usually very open with me and will tell me things that he would get away with otherwise, because he realizes the results of telling me himself will be better than not telling me- and he knows he can talk to me about anything).i really feel like it is time to go to another school.    when we left school today, i did let him know that i want happy about what happened, but then i dropped it and didn say another word about it.    instead i took him to the school that would have been my next choice, and registered him to start there next week.    i requested a teacher that is good at handling a class and experienced, so he is with one that has been there for 24 years and is the lead of.    my fear is- what do i do next if he still has problems?
2171,just into the second week in january this year, our little granddaughter aged 3 returned home from an overnight stay with her father.    we met up with our daughter within the hour as we had arranged to go out for a meal with them.    on seeing them i noted that our little granddaughter hair did not looked brushed and she looked shattered.    she greeted me as she always does with open arms and a big kiss then she begun to cry.    all evening she was very subdued, pale, and then she called sum at the table 'stinky' you are sticky.    this is not a term we use at all, especially directed at anyone and in such a tone.    i babysat her that week on the mon, wed and thus.    all three nights were very distressing.    refusing to do anything and everything.    hand in mouth.    hiding under the stairs looking very frightened to come out.    hiding under the breakfast bar on the wednesday, and crying, and looking scared and wary and then after a long period of about 30 mind would break down.    apologizing, for being bad.    saying sorry when it isn appropriate.    lashing out and kicking, refusing to get undressed at bedtime, in the mornings refusing to get dressed.     speaking in an ugly manner and shouting.    screwing up her face during all of this.    throwing her bedtime books all over the floor.    refusing bedtime stories.     not letting us brush her hair, pushing the mirror off the dressing table. dont this and dont want that. pointing into my face and her own and then pointing between her legs,    when i offered no response she did it again, her expression was hard to read.    i told her i didn understand.    she just run off.     being aggressive with the pets, we have a dog and a cat.    being aggressive with us.on the following sat we had tickets to go see sleeping beauty.    she has been before.    on this occasion her spark had gone.    gone from being a happy animated child to a combine.this all happened within one week.    the second and third week was just as eventual.    we contracted gateway, a social welfare network for protecting children.    they     advised no contact with the father and that it would be investigated.    4 weeks later they sent a very young girl to assess our little granddaughter, she only has had one, one he assessment to date.    by this time emma was having good spells.    meantime the fathers father, took sum to court to resume access, despite sum explaining to father,    the    change in her behaviour.    the judge held sum in contempt of court, and a summons would be issued if she stopped contact, and jail.     the report provided by the social worker from gateway summed it up as bordering and basically made it look like its just a petty fed between parents.     visitation was reinstated.    my daughter begged for supervision.    supervision was granted by the court but only by any member of his family.    which defeated the purpose of the whole supervision request.     the whole experience has been gut wrenching.    our solicitor did not prepare us for anything.    when the application for court was received by the fathers solicitor, the only advice he could offer was that that was foolish for them to do that and that we would just have to go with it.we have contracted a psychologist.    privately.    we have changed solicitor.we have so far felt let down by the system.     i can understand now how children can be open to abuse as the lack of interest in the social care is amazing.    this is now march and still no more word about assessment which was promised.    also they said that there would be no access while assessment were done.    however, when court contracted them by phone the social worker who did the one assessment, felt that the father posed no threat.    based on one visit.our granddaughter has changed dramatically, lost her confidence, her spark, her warm loving embraces are now few.    since visitation started back last saturday the drama has returned..there have been 2 visits since the court date.    on both those dates on returning our granddaughter displays clot of aggression, hatred, namecalling and lashing out.does this really sound like a family fed?     if my spelling and grammar have deteriorated its because i am weary.mother is so much distressed too she doesn know where to turn, she is started counselling with lifetime, to keep her head throughout this ordeal.i do know that caleche say she talks about us all the time.    fondly about all the antics we get up to.    they report this daily to us.    i know she does this at her fathers or wherever she goes.    but oddly we never hear anything much from her about fathers side of the family about what she does.     a member of staff at the caleche did disclose to me that she has only mentioned her days name recently.my question is this.     what help is there out there for us.    will the psychologist shine some light?    she is only 3.    will the court allow her to interview the father?    this is so important.    this is a plea, a prayer, to stop what is evidently destroying a beautiful being.    if there is anything else we should know, or can do, please help.this discussion is related sudden behavior changes in 3 year old.

2177,hi i am    33 years old i had my hysterectomy done in 2006 with them taking out my uterus and left very i had endometriosis bad so a year later he took out my other very with him stating to me that the pain should go away since he had gotten everything out. things seemed to be getting better but about six or eight months later i started having stomach pain again not thinking it should have anything to do with my hysterectomy so i started seeing my colon specialist to make sure i didn have endometriosis on on colon or any other things that might be going on so i had three it scars and nothing showing up on any except for one where it looked like i might have a kidney stone. my colon dr put me all different kinds of medicine for over a year. i ended up getting my appendix taken out last week and the dr had to get a ogden to help assist because he thought he had found a piece of my fallopian tube that was all puckered up irritating my kidneys, my appendix was just fine but they still removed it. the pathology report came back and it stated no fallopian tube but piece of very that formed a ovarian cyst. now i do believe when a dr tells you they got everything out and that things should be getting better shouldn come back and bite a. when a different dr has to fix what one didn do. for the last year and a half i have been dealing with bad stomach pain and i have a daughter and    twin boys    and not being able to get out and play and do certain things with them really upset me.i have clot of people telling me that i have a law suit but in not sure if i would have a case or not. has anyone ever gone threw something like this or close? please help

2183,hi,glad i found this forum.     i would up in the emergency at the end of september with severe abdominal pain.    i hadn been to a gynecologist since my last child was born 9 years ago.     well    they found a large mass in my abdomen.    they wouldn operate right away as they were waiting for tumor markets to come back to see if they were elevated.    they were, so i was transferred out of that hospital to another one to a doctor that specialized with ovarian cancer.so they took everything, both varies, they said one was a size of a football and it was bleeding.    the other one didn look good, so they took that one too.     pathology came back, no cancer, praise to god.its been 5 weeks, and i want to get on some mormons.from what i have read, nitrogen plays a vital role in a woman health.    bones, heart disease, skin, hair, eyes, the list just goes on.    i am 41 years old, and i feel i have just catapulted myself into old age by 10 years.i just went to the doctors today for my post surgery apt, they said everything looked good.     they do not recommend harmony therapy unless i would be experiencing severe symptoms.i want to get on big-identical mormons.    i feel the medical community frown upon these, but how do i go about finding a doctor?    i assume i would need blood tests to check my harmony levels, and i would need a prescription to take to a confounding pharmacy.     i have asked 2 doctors, both gynecologists about them, and they both said they would only prescribe the synthesis ones if need be.how do i locate someone to lead me down the path of big-identical.i am located in pa.thank you,

2187,my almost for old son has been petty trained since he was 2 with the exception of mrs. he has consistently refused to even try. he was put on a stool softened last year due to him holding mrs and causing both intestines to become impacted. he did that to himself when starting preschool and not wanting to have an accident there. he continues to refuse to use the toilet no matter what reward or take-away system we try. we tried taking away his pull-up but after a full month of having to continually throw away pair upon pair of underwear and parts we went back to pull-up. he simply does not care whether it is a pull up or underwear. he will go in either one equally. he has claimed to be scared of of the toilet although he sees in it just fine and has given me no reason as to why he would be scared. he will tell me time and time again that he will go on the petty. he knows that is what i want to hear and does not want to go to the doctor yet again. he rarely has an accident away from home. he will simply hold his by until he is home. he is able to do this even though he is on a high dosage of softened to make sure he does not become impacted again.can you please offer me any advice other than wait it out?
2188,hello to all and happy new year.i had a hysterectomy some 12 years ago at age 29 and have been menopaused since then.    i have given up on hot as i never found the right medicine that works for me.today, i have hashimoto's which is a form of hypothyroid and my endocrinologist has strongly advised me to take hot.    i had already tried estreva get 0.1% last year, but incidentally, when i first started applying the get as advised, i had terrible abdominal cramps (like labour cramps) and stopped the medicine after a few days of pain.    my of/by told me there was no way estreva get could be the problem and that anyway i couldn possibly have abdominal cramps as i haven got a uterus anymore.    confusing, but still, i never took the medicine again........ and the pain was gone.    to this day, i still dont know if i just had a stomach bug or if the cramps were a side effect from taking estreva.i have been taking estreva, again, for 3 weeks now (since my endocrinologist strongly advised me to and reassured me that it would be ok!).    first 2 weeks on a low dose and i was fine besides tender breasts for a few days.    i have increased the dose on the rd week (with december) and started having the most painful lower back pain on must december.    i can barely move, it feels like i pulled my back muscles but i know i didn, it radiates to my sides (almost like constipation pain but ism not constipated) and down to my legs; no over-the-counter pain tillers help.    i have very sensitive kidneys and i cannot tell if its my lower back or my kidneys hurting so bad.    one thing for sure: estreva get is the only new medicine ism taking and nothing else has changed in my diet and medicine taking.i would like to know if any of you have had similar problems with this medicine.    the information i found on the get doesn mention anything about back pain but were human so it could still be.    ism confused and not even sure i should go to the up as i have no idea if the two are related.thank you for your help.    anyone suffered the exact same problems with this medicine?

2192,my 10 years old son wakes up about 2 to 3 times a night because he is too afraid of ghost to sleep by himself. the problem started about 2 months ago. he told me that he was afraid of the dark and ghost from the scar moves that he had watched with his older cousins when he was about 7 or 8 years old. he said it did not bother him back then because he was too young to know, but now it seems to pop up in his mind when he sleep or being in the dark. he sleep thou the night only when me or my husband sleep with him or if we allow him to sleep in our room. i wonder if anyone else have similar problem or any ideas how to handle this situation and most importantly is this just a phase or can it lead to some other type of problem. have read couples of article related to this situation on other webster but it seems those kiss are much younger so i am very concern because my son is going to be in junior high next year, how much longer do i have to stay with him thou the night.
2193,i hope this is the correct forum for my question.    my father had two strokes in the last seven years.    i am an only child, so my mother and i take care of him.    he no longer works, but sometimes drives to buy groceries since its close to home.    my question is -- how do you take care of someone who does not want to be taken care of?he is the most stubborn person i know.    my mother is a nurse, yet he wont listen to her when she tells him he needs to take his medicine or watch what he eats.    in 2003, he had his first stroke after basically eating the whole pie of papa joints penza.    we thought that would be his reality check.    guess what?    it want.then 3 years ago, he had a second stroke.    reality check?    no.    he still does not believe in doctors, nor medicine. he has diabetes, just like his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc.    he also has high blood pressure, high cholestrol, and arthritis.    he refuses to believe that his stroke was caused by anything else besides diabetes.he has also suffered from depression for years, even before the stroke.    he was married with two children before he met my mother. ism sure that one reason why hers been depressed all his life.    not to mention he was the eldest of 8 children and had to leave school to work and take care of them.    he does not want to move in with his brothers and sisters (who are also retired but on the other side of the country), because of pride.lately hers been having memory lapse after waking from caps.    we dont know if these are mind-strokes, or just part of the long-term effects of strokes.    again, he is stubborn; he does not want to call his doctor about this.    he says hers fine, but ism scared that one day something serious will happen to him.    since ism an only child, hers home alone whenever my mothers at work and ism at work or class.    no one is there to watch him and make sure he takes his beds or doesn overcome on them.    we worry that when he has his memory lapse, hell overcome on the beds, not realizing he had already taken them.please, if anyone could shed some light on how to deal with this, it would be greatly appreciated.

2197,hello,i have been reading about the great benefits of all (alpha lipoid acid) in its ability to act as an antioxidant and also help with energy conversion in the body.however, what really puzzled me is that since all is produced naturally by our bodies (not an essential nutrient) how come the body doesn make more of its own to clean itself from radicals ? does our body knows something that we dont ? maybe all is not as important as we think ? ... and if we supplement, doesn it mean that our body will atrophy its own production to compensate for the excess ?also, which tissues, generate that body own all ? what mechanism are involved in its production ?

2208,my son is 16 months old and still cannot walk or talk. he has no words at all, but can stand if he is holding onto something. every doctor i see says something different. my son was born with torticollis so i always believed that his neck was effecting his ability to sit and crawl. he finally began sitting at about 10 months. he has been slow is almost all areas, he didn even get his first tooth until he was a year old.when he was one the doctor said my son was developmental delayed. that also said his head was a little large, his teeth appeared a little pointed and his penis was slightly abnormal.do all these little anomalies add up to something else? what type of doctor should i see?i feel very alone in this situation. the doctors seem to be ignoring the fact that he cannot walk or talk at all. am i over reacting or could there be something seriously wrong?

2210,i have a 5 1/2 or old son who can be very sweet at times but for reasons unknown he does not follow simple directions when asked to do something and has to be told 10-15 times within a five minute period to do what he was asked meaning daily routine tasks washing hands and face    getting dressed cleaning up his masses and constantly having to be told to eat during meal times. i have tried time out taking privileges away (to,toys etc..) at this point i am at a wits end i am running out of patience very quickly. do you have any suggestions????
2211,my three-year-old son throws a huge antrum several times a day.    for instance, we are serving x for lunch, and he wants y, and we say he needs to have a few bites of x before we can have y, and he throws a huge antrum. these antrum have gone on as long as 1 1/2    hours, and they are making us miserable. he wont give in or budge; hers incredibly flexible.and uncompromising. i know hers only three, but his 5-year-old brother has asperger's, so of course we worry that he might have a tinge of something. he also has separation anxiety at his preschool and doesn want me to leave; he usually cries when i do go but then the teachers say later that he has had a good day.my questions are these: is this normal three-year-old behavior? will he become more flexible as he mature? how do we encourage greater flexibility? and how do we handle these antrum? in general, we stick to our guns about what weave requested of him, and he sticks to his guns, so it becomes a monuments battle of wills.

2214,a few years ago, i was referred to an endodontist for possible root canal, which she did and decided that although ind had an infection, that this took care of it.    my dentist at the time after more x-rays, questioned this but i was not showing any more problems. recently, i have developed, a sore throat on the right side, my tongue on right side, underneath has an odd blister-like,    swelling and    on the right lower, the lymph gland is swollen. i am seeing another dentist, listed under    oral & maxilfocial surgery to have #is 31 & 29 removed ( upper right back ) friday.    i have had this lymph swelling neumorus times in the last 10 years, under the care of 3 different dentist.now, my question, could this cause other, seemingly unrelated symptoms ?     ism experiencing, a lot of stomach problems, diagnosed 6 yes ago as is but more recently seeming to be worse---- a lot of burning in stomach and abdomen..& pain/aching in my spine.    my system seems to be very pacific and i am tired. ism already diabetic and have fibro so its hard to determine if this infection ( as my dentist seems to think it is,) is causing these added problems.has anyone had certain conditions go from bad to worse, due to an infection of this type ?
2215,i have a 3 children one 5 one 3 and one 1.the problem we are faced with is with our for old son. ism not his real dad and his real dad has not seen him since he was eyes old. have started the adoption process and i have sat down with him and explained everything to him and he understands a lot more than i thought he would.i think our problems started about 2 years ago when we moved away from the area we were brought up as kiss and were my son was starting to get into things.it started with not doing as being told. then we put him into a play school and he seemed to have gotten worse from then on he was there for about 3 months when my partner and i pulled him out of it.this seemed to help for a week or so then he went back to telling lies stealing things from his brother not sharing toys sitting in a corner on his own and so the list goes on.we tried everything we could think of to get him out of it but with no luck. it just seemed to make him worse. if he had a good day we rewarded him for it but that was chucked back in our faces as soon as he got his reward.we tried the no to no toys sitting on his bed shouting at him talking to him sitting in the corner watching other kiss playing timeouts days out all of it with no affect on him.we thought he might start behaving a bit more when he started school last year but this seems to have made no change.at school and round other people  s houses hers as good as gold does as hers told we his told and uses his manners.i sat down with a few weeks ago and asked him why he is being like this and it took a good his before he started saying anything other than dont know up canst think etc.he said he wanted to live nearer to his grandma's and granddad  s. i took this on bored and spoke with my partner who is not too sure that this will change his way and is thinking of moving. ism up for moving as ism willing to give it a try but i have told him that in order for us to move he must first show me that he is going to behave. i have also explained that if we do move it will be me giving up my college course of which ism not even half way though and we canst just click our fingers and move threes a lot more to it than that.does anyone have any ideas of what we can do to get him to behave we are at our wits end with him.many thanks in advance russell.
2216,hi, i dont know if this is the right place to post this question since its usually about children and tens but my parents are rude.    off the back rude to be honest.they tell me to move or do this right now! or say come here right now!and before i would use to just do whatever they say, but now ism at my wits.    ism ready to say enough is enough!    i want to get this problem over with.    i know, its usually the parents dealing with this kind of stuff with their children but this time its me that has to deal with my parents who are acting like children.sometimes i do say to them at the grocer store at the checkout if they say move this cart to that side now. and then i say excuse me to the cashier while i pull my mon or dad to the side and then i tell them that was very rude.    dont you dare try and say that to me again.    you think you can just say that to me in front of people like that?    no.    i need you to apologize right now please! and if they say no.    who do you think your talking to? and then i say apologize right now please! and then if they say the same thing again i just go to the cashier and say ism sorry, we dont need these groceries anymore.    do you mind putting them back? and then my parents become irate and then i pull them out of the store and then we all go home.    usually i would've spanned them for their behavior but that usually at home because they did it to me before so i learned from them.    i dont do that anymore, because its so rare that i would hit them thinking i would regret it after.so please help me deal with my parents.    i need them to be more respectful because at the moment i am like parma to them.    if they are mean to me i am mean to them, if they hit me i hit them harder, if they are nice to me, ism nice to them.thanks :)dere

2219,in atasol is is there any trace of morphin in them because it showed up in my drug screen and i never took morphin
2220,hey ism hannah and ism 18.now before i start explaining i already know i am going to get plenty of lectures from worried adults but yes my parents know i cut and so does my therapist and everyone else who is important. i know i shouldn do it and its bad for me and leaves horrible scars for a temporary situation ism completely aware and know the consequences for doing this but what i do need is advice. i canst stop. give been to hospitals and recovery groups and all that jazz but we all know those things never really solve anything. i dont know why but when i feel like ism losing control of a situation i cut. i take a razor to my thigh. give been doing this since i was 13 and no its not a cry for attention. no one knew until i was 16 when i told my parents i was going to kill myself. and from there i went to a mental hospital for a week.when i cut i feel like ism in control of something for once and when its over i feel a sense of..calmness. but a few minutes later when i look at the damage i did i feel like a big part of me has died. i want to stop but its the only thing i have control over. my brother passed away 2 years ago. he was my best friend and also had depression like me. he always promised that everything would be okay and to be strong like him but when he got in that fatal car accident in 2010 we found out he over doses on his depressions pills and passed out behind the wheel. we dont know if he just wanted a high, an accident or a suicide but my brother would never do anything to hurt anyone else and he was not suicidal in my mind. but whatever it was, was the result of him going 98 may on a highway and hitting another car. it was never determined if he died of the of or the crash..both would have killed him and yes the person he hit is fine, he hit the back of her truck. after that, i felt like i dont know like the hope i had of being okay was gone.i think about it clot and just try to think of the awful scars i already have and how i dont want to make more. i guess my real question is, how do you express your emotions without hurting yourself? give tried writing, running, reading and of course seeing a therapist. i dont want to cut anymore and i know my brother would not want me doing this.what can i do to get my emotions out in a healthy way?
2221,my son is 2. he does not listen to anything we say. he shouts clot. and when we discipline him he just dont care. he goes it to a day dream clot. and he has also started shouting in his sleep. he does this at least 4 times a note.
2222,i have a (non identical) twin daughters (manna & miss) and they are in their with months old, both in a good healthy situation.sometimes manna, when she stares on any thing like (to, picture, faces ...etc) she came with several fully (not the normal or if we name it over) eyes blinking 3-4 times according to the distance between her eyes and that thing, when she gets closer to the to for example she came with 6-7 ones.usually we keep them away from the to, about 3 peters minimum, she is very active, joyful and funny same as her twin sister.me and her mother really afraid because of this, also we dont have any one in both of our families with this case or even wearing eyeglasses.for your advice please.
2223,i am a manager of my community pool in my homes association.    normally these pools do not have a life guard on duty but have rules posted saying no children under 12 allowed without an adult swimmer, 18 or older).    other rules for safe are posted too: no food, alcohol, glass, animals in pool area.    no running etc.    you've all seen them if you have been in these pools.this is my first year as the manager and only day 4. we have 214 units in our how with about 25% of these now being rental of absentee landlords.    most of these rental turn over every year or two bring new families.just in the past 4 days i have seen very few adults at the pool with their children who are under 12.    trying to enforce this rule is almost impossible.please parents:    do not let you kiss go to any pool without proper supervision. do not depend on other people to watch your kiss.    we have tried issuing keys, but these kiss are smart--they just open the gates from the inside.    we did try a pool watched but they dont show up.    dont let your kiss be the ones responsible for shutting down    great summertime entertainment for the whole area.    remind your kiss that alcohol & swimming do not go good together.thanks for reading this.

2229,my 5 year old once again today spit on another child.    this has happened now 2 days in a row.    it also happened last week.    i have asked him why he did it and he says its because the other children wont let him play or that it was his turn to talk.    we have talked about how to use our words instead of spitting.    today, i was very upset that it had happened again.    i have warned him twice that if he did it again that i would wash his mouth out with soap.    well, today i did as i said and followed through with the soap and put him in his room.    at first it didn even phase him and then 10 or 15 minutes in the tears started.    he will start kindergarten next year and ism sure they will not tolerate him spitting at school.    ism not real sure how many more times my daycare will allow this behavior before they ask us to leave if it doesn stop.    please give me some guidance as to what i should do to stop this behavior?

2233,i need some advice.    i have a 4 year old boy who loves to play with pirates and skeleton.    it was cut and fun at first, but now it is getting to be too much and i fear that is all he is thinking about.    most children i meet have a broad spectrum of what they enjoy but he is pretty stuck on this.    have been reading books to him since he was born, when he was two i read a human body book and he was intrigues by skeleton.    so i thought now! my son must be    a doctor podgy ( how dumb was i). so i think clot of this was my fault.    while i should have introduced many different things such as thomas the train, we were learning the human anatomy and causing the halloween isles, because that was the only place they had skeleton.    while he learned clot of the anatomical correct names, this fascination seems to have evolved to become gross.    i fear that the 2 years of this could have caused some mental damage because it was not age appropriate.    so gradually i slowly threw clot of the halloween door away and have been trying to introduce different things, but he is just not interested and seems to withdraw.    what should i do??    i had him in preschool last year, he made friends easily and was quite social.    his teacher said that all the pictures he drew were of skeleton.    she said that we was a good student and listened well.    am i just being weird?    what can i do to help introduce things in an easier fashion?    did i cause irreversible damage?        please help....
2234,i have a 5 year old with severe cutis, he was diagnosed 2 and a half years ago.for the past year and a half i have noticed my other son who is 3, turning 4 in a couple of months is not developing as expected.everytime i give him food to eat he will throw it or smear it into the floors and walls, each time he does this i remove the food from him and give him 3 minutes time out, i have been doing this for 12 months with no result, he is also very aggressive, he constantly hits and bite me or throws things at me, again he gets 3 minutes time out each time but it doesn make a difference. he attacks his teachers at school, he is not interested at all in being petty trained, he smear his stools from his underpants all over my walls and floors.he is constantly on the go from am until pm, he doesn sit down for a second, and if he does he has to mess with something or someone.even if i take him out for a treat he will climb all over the place. he also seems to have no sense of danger even after hurting himself numerous time doing the same things. he also doesn take any instruction from anyone, at school or from me. when you talk to him it just goes right through him, he he had hearing and sight checked and they are fine.the health visitor has referred his to a child development centre after seeing his behaviour at the 3 year check up, she told me i am doing everything right with him, like praising every little good thing he does, ignoring some behaviour and using the time out discipline.i am at a dead end, i am so physically tired and mentally drained with trying he isn interested in any toys either, he only ever wants to play with toilet rolls.my house is a mess as every day he breaks something, he has just pushed my brand new to off the table today, smashed 6 eggs on the floor earlier on. it is like this everyday. what could possibly be wrong with him? any ideas? his speech is fine and so is his eye contact.

2236,hi this isn really about a hysterectomy... but i couldn find a related category. i currently am having pain in my vagina. give had a least infection before and i dont think this is one. there is no white discharge stuff but its really red and irritated. it burns to see and its uncomfortable. it kind hurts and i tried having sex and it hurt.it all started after my last pack of birth control pills. i normally on my pill have a 3 day period. this past month i was still bleeding when i had to start my new pack of pills so i bleed for 7 days +. anyway, i didn think anything of it and took a minocylin pill i use for acne and ever since have been having these issues. i am 100% positive it isn an st. so is it still a least infection just without the white **** or just horribly irritated or what? also how can i make it stop!?!

2244,my daughter just turned 6 and in the last few months we have been noticing some behavior issues that are very concerning.    it almost seemed as though she couldn distinguish between reality and imagination, wondering if what she thought of may have actually happened.    an example of this, she would say i dont know if i picked up that baby referring to a stranger at the store, or i dont know if i drank that water referring to the water that had gathered in a rotted out pushkin.    very outlandish comments, but she really want sure if it had happened or not.    in the last month or so she started saying she couldn remember things she just did, such as brushing her teeth, or wiping or finishing her meal.    she will go up to brush her teeth and i will see her brushing, but she is confused after and doesn know if she actually did it.her teacher hasn noticed anything as severe as this at school, but she did say that my daughter bones out at school at least few times a week, to where she will have to pull her back in to get her rousing again.    i mentioned this to her red. and she wants to follow up in a few weeks and suggested ordering thyreoid tests or possibly a mental evaluation.    it has been very scar to watch some of these behavior and i am hoping that it is just a phase.    just hoping i might be able to get some advice until then, because i haven been able to find much about this online.

2248,in case you missed it, the da cited a food processing plant in yakima, washington called snakish for mold applesauce.    this company is a food supplier for the government school lunch programs.    an article i just read had even more deplorable description of the facility than what was reported in the nightly news.    absolutely disgusting the descriptions i read about the condition the facility has been in while it is processing this stuff as food that goes across the entire country.    ism shocked that i am not reading anything about recalls of this food.    i dont care how hot the vast are that the applesauce get, ism not interested in eating something that they skin the mold off of and get away with calling it food.    i have enough food sensitivities without aggravating the problems by allowing toxic mold to get cooked into the apple sauce--along with reading about the conditions i read in the article i will post the link to shortly.if any of us were to make our own homemade apple sauce, we would never use apples that were obviously mold.    we would have the good sense to throw out the apples that were so unfit for consumption, because we know it isn safe.    we would use the freshness and cleanest fruit we had on hand.i just thought it was too important not to alert other people of this serious issue in the food supply.    this isn right to do, because that mold canst be good for anyone who already has compromised health, even if it is supposedly killed     by the cooking process.    plus, it would obviously change the flavor.    ism definitely throwing out anything with that company name and any canned apple sauce with a not so well known brand name.    supposedly none of it reached any food banks or schools, but how can they really be so sure, since the company was cited more than once in recent months and didn really change its practices once the health inspector went on their way and had their backs turned.    i wont be leaving the stuff ism throwing out for anyone else to take for themselves, because i canst be sure its safe.    this company has lost all points with me.    this is absolutely appalling to me.http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/11/da-company-sent-mold-applesauce-to-school-lunch-program/

2254,my son has had penis foreseen which doesn stretch back, leading to itchiness and redness for the last three years. i find that now he often candles and plays with his penis. is it mainly because of his itchiness or he finds pleasure in doing so? when confronted he says that he finds nice feeling in doing so. please advise?thanks,
2255,in the last year or so, my nephew has demonstrated behavior that has raised suspicion of sexual abuse or inappropriate touching in the past.    he has been to a counselor and social services have met with him, but no solid conclusion was ever reached.    recently, he visited his maternal grandmother house (with the mother) and upon returning, he intentionally need in his bedroom.    have just learned that this is the and or rd time that he has done this and all after having visited at his grandmother.    (please note that this is the residence at which any suspected abuse would've taken place, as it is where he lived the first 3 or 4 years of his life.)    when the grandmother is approached about his behavior, she says that its probably because he doesn get enough attention at home.    we are at a loss... there just seems to be too much of a connection between his behavior and its timing for the two not to be related.    what is driving this behavior?ism not sure what other information you would need in order to accurately make an assessment, but ism assuming that it may be helpful to know that he is 5 years old and has a 1 year old half-brother.any insight you may be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.    thank you!

2262,ok, so i am 20 years old and i have been smoking for almost six months now. progressively, i began to smoke more and more out of control until recently i began waking up with terrible nausea and the jersey squires.    i understand that what i was doing was irresponsible, i was using to help avoid depression symptoms and allowed myself to make a habit out of something i was trying to use in a medicinal way.    i ended up in the er so terribly dehydrated that my blood was like diese.    i ended up getting 4000 acts of fluid intravenously due to the fact that i couldn even drink water.    i am ashamed to say that essentially i let myself get so high all the time to the point i was starving myself of water and nutrition.    at this point i will say this: if you smoke weed make dark sure you are daring for yourself. you would be surprised at how much you may or may not be treating yourself as i did so please learn from my stupidity.    at this point, ism stuck with this decision:    do i smoke now while ism still feeling a little ill just to feel a little better and induce slight appetite?    or should i try to cold turkey it for awhile, which is leaving me so very hungry?    any help from people with experience with this issue will be more than appreciated.
2263,my grandson was born very early weighing only sobs. oz.    he had complications but came through them but stayed in the hospital for 2 months.    he is a very bright and creative child.    he is also very quiet and shy and spends a lot of time alone.    he does very well in school and is even in some talented and gifted classes.    my concern is that he throws fits at school and now is throwing fits on a regular basis.    if he cannot do something perfect he gets very angry.    i had him twice in the last month and was shocked at the fits that he was throwing.    i did even pop him once because he threw a toy down and caught me off guard and i just reacted.    normally i do not sank my grandkids.    also, he is so disrespectful to me and really wont even talk to me.    i sometimes have to ask him a question several times before he will answer me and his answers are very monotony and rude.    he gets so angry playing video games that he will begin to cry his frustration level gets so high.    i am pretty sure that his dad acts this way to him and this is where he is learning this behavior.    i am worried about my grandson.    i try to talk to my son about his behavior but he says he knows he needs to change but he doesn think he can.    i have to be very careful because i know if i say too much i will probably get told to mind my own business.    i am so worried about my grandson, he is way too young too be so angry, i have never seen a 7 year old behave this way.    i know you canst tell me what to do but possibly some suggestions.    i would appreciate it.
2264,so this is my first 3 year old, but i am beside myself.    he is almost 4 years old and i seriously dont know what to do with him.    he is so crouch and can be just mean to other kiss.    he gets so mean and nasty when he thinks that someone is being mean to him or doesn do what he wants.    i took him to a b-day party tonight and he was playing and then all the sudden i looked at him and he was arguing with a little girl and giving her death looks.    this usually happens the places i take him.    my husband thinks it is normal, but i dont.    he wants to play with other kiss, but then has a hard time doing it.    it broke my heart tonight when he came over and said, none wants to play with me.    but honestly, if he was being nasty to them, i dont blame them.    i have had so many talks with him about being nice to others and i dont know what else to say.    he often thinks he is being funny by making up little phrases and saying them to other kiss, your a bubblegum head.    i know that he is just trying to be funny, but other kiss dont usually think so and then they are turned off by being around him.    i have also tried to talk to him about this.    he is not a good share either.    if there is a toy that he wants, he will not share it, no matter who asks him.    i want him to have friends, but he is making it difficult for others to like him.    is this normal?    it doesn seem like other kiss are acting this way.    many of the kiss at the b-day party were playing together and having fun.    we take him places that he is around other kiss.    he goes to school 2 times a week, i have friends who have kiss his age he plays with, we have signed him up for different classes with kiss his age.    i just need feedback.    thank you.
2265,my daughter is six. she is a middle child, two older brothers (12 and 9) and one younger (5). she is very grown up which, for the most part, i am grateful. she can clean her room, takes her own baths/brushes her own teeth/gets herself dressed, etc... she does very well in school. her teacher says she is very bright and she rarely needs help on homework. 95% of the time she is the perfect child...but there is that 5% of the time that makes me nuts. she talks back. not in an ugly way but like tonight i told her to go to bed and she said that her older brothers agent in bed yet. or if i ask her to take something back to her room or whatever she will point out that so and so has something in there that they agent taking back. we were leaving my comes tonight and all four kiss were acting like clowns. i said stop jumping and screaming. you all are acting like two year old. she walked off and i heard her say two year old canst talk. i just really wanted to sank her for that dartmouth! but have tried that and it does no good. she also whites a lot and cries every morning when its time to get up and get ready. she has started many a day with a spanning for turning her to on and standing in front of it when she is supposed to be getting dressed or for laying back down when she is supposed to go eat breakfast. to make it worse she battles on my to her father when i sank her and he gets mad at me. he is very hard on the boys but rarely punishes her. last week she rubbed her fingers on her bottom and then waved her hand in her 9 to brothers face. her dad thought this was funny. i had to be the heavy and punish her for it.
2266,hi all,my friend who is 60 has experienced vaginal bleeding. she went to the doctor and the doctor who did a scan of the womb first of all said there is a thickening of the linking of the womb but that he doesn think its cancer (he showed her all the scan pictures too), but he has referred her for a d and c (she has to have a general). she is very over weight.bit worried that he didn think it was cancer yet has referred her for more tests. if he thought it want then why would he refer her for more tests?any ideas? if the doctor doesn think its cancer, are they normally right, do they normally have a good idea by looking at scars?thank you in advance.
2267,hello!    last december (2006) i had a lash.    i didn have sex for a few months afterwards, but now, still to this day, sex is nearly intolerable.    anyone else have this issue?

2269,my daughter has always been a pick although healthy later, but she has begun holding all foods in her mouth and cheeks until it is liquefied, and/or chess her food into tiny pieces before swallowing. she barely ate one of her favorite foods (sesame chicken) saying it was too crutch or hard. we have tried ignoring it, as well as talking to her about it, but it seems to be getting worse. she is losing weight now, and was pretty slim to begin with. we thought it was sort of a game to her at first but it seems to be more of an issue that she has no desire to change now. any ideas as to what is causing this or how to stop it?
2270,my daughter is exactly the same.... give cried and cried.... i tried the 123 magic with no hope.... give done everything... i thought maybe it was because she was the and child, but she gets the same attention i showed my first child..... i hope this passes....she is allergic to mold, dust miles, and sugar....she just started kindergarden (so no caps any more) and we moved.... but she was doing the temper thing in our old home too.... so it can be the move... it might be sugar??this discussion is related temper antrum from 5 1/2 year old girl with typically sweet disposition.
2271,hello, i just have a question pertaining to my of and her 14 year old son. she has been a single mon for half of her sons life and then got married when the boy was at age seven (her ex-husband was not his biological father). obviously she has now gotten a divorce and we met early on in her separation from her ex-husband (little over a year ago). i have noticed that on occasion her 14 year old boy sleeps with her whenever ism not there (i work nights four days out of a week) and recently - in the last week or two - this behavior has somewhat increased. he has slept with her probably three or four nights that i haven been there over that time frame. i feel uncomfortable with that situation occurring, mainly because of the child age but also because neither one of them (especially my of) seem uncomfortable with it. furthering more background to this is the fact that the boy is more sexualized for his age then some other kiss that i know in his age group. also in her previous relationship with her ex-husband, the boy would try and sleep together with them and be forced by the ex-husband to sleep on the floor in their bedroom, right up until the boy was roughly 12-13 years old, when finally he slept in his own room. finally, my of did confide in me that one night last summer, he did enter her (our) room and tried to imitate me while she was sleeping - talking in a low voice, calling her by her name rather than as just mon and some other things that i did find disturbing. i feel that ism not over-reacting to this and i haven brought it up with her yet, but feel that maybe little honest feedback would help me before i decide on what my next action should or shouldn be.
2272,i feel like i am out of option when it comes to disciplining and working on behavior issues with my almost 4 year old boy. we have tried a variety of methods and none seem to work. i read a lot of information on behavior issues and discipline but the standard line is to be consistent. we are consistent. we do not back down from the rules and he always gets caught and has to go through punishment, but it does not seem to make a difference. the biggest issue is that there seems to be a major control issue that goes on, but i dont know if there is more to it. it started out with antrum. besides the normal ones at home, once he seemed to realize he couldn get away with them there he would wait until we were out in public and then try to do whatever he wanted. this was about a year ago. he would try to sit up in the cart and stand and i would tell him to sit down. he would look around and then right at me and smile and slowly stick his foot back up to stand. when i would get him out he would start to scream and throw a fit. so every time we went out in public this would happen in some form so we would take him to the car and he would have to sit in there until he screamed it out. eventually this stopped, but he just moved on to something else. the next thing became playing in bed. he shares a room with his brother and they have bank beds. well, he would play in bed for hours. he would grab onto the bars from the bed above and swing on them. jump around, etc. we have a video monitor so we would catch him every time. he would go to time out and lose privileges. this lasted around two months an then he transferred his behavior to preschool. first it was running away from the teacher and laughing and not doing what she would say. oh, he also has an issue with women. he does not listen or obey as well as he does with men. then it was water. he also has an issue with this. an possession about water and if allowed he will drink and drink and not stop causing him to see himself continually. so then he tried to speak water all the time. then when that stopped he started intentionally seeing himself. he would stand up in the middle of circle time, spread his legs and see in front of everyone and he is fully petty trained. this went on for a few months. then school ended and now the seeing has stopped but he has started to throw fits in time out and in public. he doesn throw himself on the ground    anymore, but whites and cries for hours especially in public when he doesn get his way and he has been playing in bed again. he just seems to move through various issues after each ones eventually doesn work after months of trying it. we give time out, take away toys, lost privileges. he doesn get to do certain things when his brother does when he has been bad. we have a chart with sticks and if they get a certain amount they get a piece of candy and if more a toy. he doesn care about this. he shows off his was to people instead of the sticks. we thought he might like the negative attention so we try ignoring him. still has consequences like time out but he gets ignored in time out and then has to play by himself instead of getting attention. nothing works. he doesn seem to care. he just keeps doing it. i have no idea what to do and it is frustration that everything we try seems to no avail and reading advice never seems to help as it is already what we do. any suggestions?
2273,i nancy for a family with three kiss.    9,7, and 4.    the four year old is a girl and has just this week started acting strange.    on monday she went petty and was in there forever.    she was being really private about it all and was shutting me out completely.    she flushed but for at least 20 minutes, if not more, she kept wiping and wiping.    her mother told me this was not too strange as she has done this before but after she finished she refused to put underwear on.    she wouldn tell me why and she also refused parts.    she went around with just a shirt on the rest of the day.the next day i went to the house in the morning and for almost 2 hours the mon fought with her about having to wear underwear.    she cried and cried, i dont want to wear underwear!    she also will not wear parts.    since tuesday she understands she must wear underwear, but she will not wear parts.    her mon and i have to dress her in only dresses, which is getting tricky with the weather getting colder and colder.i have noticed in the past week or so that she also always has her hand in her parties and wants a lot more private time.    she has started wanting to be in her room alone and wants me to go outside so she can stay alone inside.    yesterday, i went outside to play with her shillings and when i came back in to check on her, she had her hand in her parties again.she has also started to freak out when i tell her that we need to go somewhere (school, to get her shillings, dance, etc).    today when i put her in her carpet she creaked out when i tried to buckle it saying, i dont want it buckled!    i told her i had to and convinced her to do so.    right when i placed her in the carpet, she put her hand in her parties.    ism worried its a new habit or some kind of coming mechanism for anxiety she is having.    and i wonder if the reason she didn want the seat buckled was due to not being able to put her hand in her parties.i am at such a loss for what to do, as is everyone close to her.    i want so badly to understand so i can help her, but i am helpless.
2274,my grand-daughter has just today turned 10.    her mon and dad are divorced, but on fairly good terms.    my son is remarked to a girl whom the kiss love.    lately my 10 year old granddaughter does not want to go to her days.    she goes into her bedroom and stays there, she will not eat (even her birthday cake).    she has been lying , and text essaying four letter words to her friends.she also has bouts of diarrhoea when she comes to my sons.    just last year she wanted to homelike with her dad and his new wife permanently.    he told her that he would love that, but she must discuss it first of all with her mon.    now, she doesn even want to come when its his weekend to have them.    they (my son and his wife) have an 18 month old son, whom both the girls love very much, but lately the one granddaughter doesn even bother with him.her mother is very manipulation, and i am wondering if this could be caused by something that is going on in her mothers home.    her mother works nights, and her stepped takes care of both the girls.    he is very good to them.i have a i-polar condition and my son used to suffer from anxiety.    could any of this be influencing my granddaughter.we love her so much, and so desperately need advice and guidance.any help will be appreciated.thank you
2275,please help!hi there i have a 3 year old son with down syndrome. he is adorable but sometimes his behaviour becomes very difficult to manage. he refuses to eat at the table with the family and if he is left to sit with with us he will escapade into a full blown antrum in: bang his head try to throw himself off the chair, scream inconsolable and become aggressive. he doesn calm down and can behave like this for up to 2 hours. he will sometimes only eat if i distract him with toys or the to. he bites, scratches, pulls hair and flaps when he is angry. normally these episodes happen several times a day but he does have good and bad patches where sometimes its worse, sometimes its better. a few days ago he got into a temper because i tried to feed him his breakfast. he hit his face on the floor so hard he made his nose bleed. ism really struggling to cope.can anyone suggest anything or offer any advice? could it be possible that he also has artistic spectrum disorder. i canst get any medical professional to take my concerns seriously. some of them have suggested i am being an over anxious mother, but when he is seen he is mostly happy and contented. they dont see the other side of him.many thanks sarah
2276,my 3 1/2 year old daughter has been having daily inconsolable antrum for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the past 2 weeks.    recently my wife went back to work and we put our children into daycare.    the daycare staff advises us that my daughter does great and when i arrive to pick her up she seems to be happy and having a good time.    however, when we get home she become increasingly agitated until she finally has a antrum and then she just canst seem to recover.    we have tried rousing her attention on other things and timeouts but nothing seems to calm her down.    the last two days i have put her in the bath early and it seems to calm the antrum.    does anyone have any suggestions or advise?
2277,i want to get some people  s opinions. this month i think my do and i have finally gotten the deed done. but of course i am still waiting to be able to take a hot. i am on   do   from my population trace but i  m 11 days from my first positive oak (i  ve had 8 positive oak  s in a row) and its day 33 on my cycle. now, i can  t really say how regular i am because i have cos and i am normally on closed plus this is my third cycle since my m/c back in july and the first time for my do and i to etc. so i was thinking about taking my prometrium. i  m thinking of doing this because; i believe i  ve m/c because of my progesterone levels were very low in the beginning and i was put on to prometrium but i think i started it too late. and if i  m not pregnant then it will induce my period and i can start my first round of closed again. does this sound feasible?
2278,occasionally, my 15 month old son has hand tremors, which concern me.    the hand shaking is usually right after a nap, where he is still a little sleepy.    the tremors last anywhere from 1-3 minutes, that i see.    i first noticed them when he was as young as 10 months old.    i have touched his hand to stop them and when i release his hand they continue.    this is not a daily occurrence.    is this something to be worried about?
2279,hello everybody. i was hoping to get some advice/feedback on a particular topic. my step-daughter has been with me and my husband for 2 days and sheds going home today. during the entire time the to has been on, and she always throws a fit when we turn it off. i am getting concerned for her, because she does look a bit overnight, and has a pretty bad attitude. on top of that, her language skill are low, and most of the time bubbles. it sometimes takes us a few minutes to figure out what sheds saying. sheds almost 4, and will be going to school in september.is this caused by her always having the to on, or are there other causes such as how sheds raised at home (she lives with her mother, and ism not sure on how she treats her and discipline her). does anybody have any suggestions on how to sort of fix her attitude and behavior? its getting to the point that i dont want to be around when sheds here because she only causes trouble, and never listens. i know kiss are like that, but this is a bit extreme.thanks in advance for any advice.
2280,my daughter is in a shared printing situation, her child dad lives with his parents, they are in a dirty court battle over school issues since he is starting kindergarten, the mother had day off on tuesday, (the child normally would ride bus), but the child spent his normal monday at his days, who does not live in the school district, she told the father monday evening, since she was off that she would pick up the child at 7 to get him home in time to catch the bus, which is at 7:35. i, the maternal grandmother went with her and the paternal grandfather (after waiting for 10 min) came to the door and said we are not giving him to you,,its not happening and then blamed the door in her face. i wittenested the whole thing. last evening, thursday, when the child was at his home with his mon, he told her, papa did not slam door, please dont be mean to my other papa. now, i ask you, doesn that sound like someone is teaching or choosing this child to either lie, or actually smooth over the truth??? is this acceptable behavior??? please help us.
2281,my 13 year old son with add is having a horrible year with teachers who dont know how to work with him at all.    he is constantly looking assignment, teachers score his work lower than it should be (i have path tests to prove it), he has been in suspension more times than i think are warranted for arguing with a teacher.    they want all children to do exactly what they are told exactly when they are told to do it.    my son doesn transition well between classes.    they want him out of honors - which i feel if he gets out of honors he will be more distracted in the other class. he refuses all meditations and i will not force meditations on him.    i am at my wits end in dealing with the school.    my kid has a 504 plan.    i have sought the help of the 504 coordinate & administrators but no results. special ed isn an option since he doesn meet the state criterion for qualifying. i want to pull him out since i know the way the teachers dont know how to work with him and i personally feel like they dont care either.    what am i to do?    the kicked is i work full-time so homeschooling is out. i would love to do the private school thing - but in this area they are all religious schools with doctrines that we really dont believe personally - besides i dont know if they would do any better. i would love to hear from anyone that has been in a similar situation how it turned out both good and bad since we can learn from each other.
2282,how smart is your right foot?you have to try this , it takes 2 seconds.this will bottle your mind and you will keep you trying over and over again to see if you can outsmart your foot, but, you canst.its pre-programme in your brain!1. without anyone watching you (they will think you are good......) and while sitting at your desk in front of your computer, lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles.2. now, while doing this, draw the number '6' in the air with your right hand. your foot will change direction.i told you so!    and there nothing you can do about it! you and i both know how stupid it is, but before the day is done you are going to try it again, if you've not already done so.

2288,hi, i am a 52 year old woman who was always suspected of hypothroidism. i have always had a weight problem but, because i always ate healthy, no sugar, no salt mostly veggies and salad. never was a meat matter, always had to eat several egg whites a day for protein.doctors really need to look further than at a persons body size in considering what is wrong. not all heavy people eat clot or improperly. and    heavy people obviously can have hyperthyroidism. under-treated or untreated hyperthyroidism is bad. for years i have had many symptoms of thyreoid probe, both hope and hyper. eyes bulging out of head, extreme fatigue alternating with hyperacvtivity,brittle hair(used to have such good hair salons never wanted to cut it), heart palpitating,dry eyes, constant fainting, have not had to twelve eyebrows in 10 years, barely any hair on legs and underarms, insomnia and etc. i have always had very low blood pressure and was recently told it was too low,, low sugar(glucose),;of cholestrol, all indicative of how i eat , not what was assumed because of my size and rapid weight gain weekly. i went to doctor and told him my symptoms, at first he giggler and said by looking at you i know you do not have hyperthyroids.how rude and condescending, once again i was just a fat person who all of my problems were that i was fat, not thinking for once the weight was a symptom, not a cause. as you can see i am angry, sorry. i dieted, went to a    nutritionist, etc.    etc. i continued to gain weight, but there were periods as well that i was hunger, eating more, eyes bulging, heart palpitating, extreme mood swing and very hyper, not sleeping, but losing eight. i gave in, figured i needed a psychiatric, went that route, was not it,my eight went to a shopping 378 pounds with extreme rapid gain, i could not take it anymore, i decided to get barbaric surgery. once again i was pressing for surgery and my thyreoid test was bad, indicative of hyperthyroidism.i was informed to go to my pp, i did, once again another doctor said no way    i should be skinny therefore it is not right. i went ahead with the surgery and have since lost 110 pounds and am 20,000.00 poorer. i had several more lab tests done since and thyreoid got worse after each time.i am now going to another doctor an endocrimologist, they think i have and am going between hope and hyper.my brain functions is not what it was, no memory, cannot comprehend clot, cannot focus, first half of day i am hyper(no caffein), then at about 1:20 i start to crash. i am actually exhausted and hyper at same time. i have headache which i have never had before,pain in right eye, bulging eyes, weakness.i went to a carddiologist to rule out my heart, it is all great.i am told and read that diagnosed and untreated hyperthyroidism can lead    to calcium repletion(osteoporosis) quickly and am frustrated and concerned with what the overlooking of this condition has caused my body and overall health. is it possible to have both hyper and hope at same time, and how can a person be heavy and hyper? also, i    read that rapid weight loss can cause an increase in    amiodarone, which can cause hyperthyroidism, is this so?also i have growled and researches barbaric surgery and hyperthyroidism and found that many people have been diagnosed post op with hyperthyroidism. is there a    direct or indirect correlation between the two?
2289,my legs get very itchy after i shower, this has never happened to me before but its been severe for about 3 months. i use dove bodywash, and i put lotion (target brand) on my legs whenever they feel dry so i dont think its dry skin that causing this. it gets so much worse after i shave my legs that have considered not shaving them anymore. i canst wear parts for about an hour after i shower or the itching is absolutely unbearable.is there a specific topical treatment i could use? lotions, bodywashes, etc? thank you so much for your input!

2291,hi    i have a soon to be 8 year old daughter who is causing me some concern.    she is expelling at school and the teachers say she is very clever, the problem however is that socially she is very immature.    she squeaky rather than talks and when she does talk its all baby language - this only occurs at home and never at school. she pretends on numerous occasions that she is an animal and sides around the house rather than walking.    she will never dress herself and has poor hygienic habits - forgetting to wipe herself and leaving toilet roll on the floor rather than flush it she also forgets to wash her hands on numerous occasions.    overall she is a lovely clever girl but i am very worried that she is not making friends like she should and is repressing back to being a baby and this behaviour is very worrying.    she stays with her ran after school while we are out working and she is surrounded by her cousins varying in age from 1 year to 10 years old so its not as if she doesn see more grown up children.    i would add that she has a little brother of 3 who is already leaps and bounds ahead of her socially.    when we ask her to do things she can look at you blandly as if she really hasn understood what you have said - its so confusing when her school work is excellent and progress reports at school are outstanding.    help!

2296,i am a single mother with a 21 month year old boy named dmitri. he has medical problems from the day he was born. a week after being born, he had such a bad eczema problem he appeared to be wearing a mask of cradle cap. we found out that this a reaction from an clergy to breast milk and other food that i was eating. we later discovered that he is allergic to food in general and also to many other allergens. his only source of nutrition is a diet consisting only of a formula called elevate. even on the diet, he is constantly broken out and itching due to many reasons. he also gets lots of flair up that consist of pus-filled and oozing sores on his body. this flair up causes him to be still getting up like a new born so he is often drained. he is on steroids and anthrax twice a day among many other medicines. often, he is up to 15 different drugs and he takes the maximum dosage of each. i am worried about the long-term effects of these medicines. the doctors are now suggesting a feeding tube and that is a step i would like to avoid, if possible. they are also asking me to take him to a super specialist doctor but i canst afford it because my insurance wont cover it due to it being out of state. i would like to ultimately be able to feed him something other than his formula and get him healthy enough to not need so many meditations so; he can have a normal childhood. this is his last resort. if we canst get him to a super specialist there saying i might have to make funeral arrangements.

2310,last week a 6 or old boy (well call him child c )at school came forward and told his teacher that another for old boy,his friend (well call him child b)    had sucked his penis and he didn feel comfortable with what happened. child b, when questioned how/why this took place, he stated that he had previously exchanged such sex acts with my son, well call child a. my son said he thinks it happened many many times, both he and child b    had sucked each other multiple times. he said they started with kissing, and he couldn give me a reason why for any of it. he doesn seem to know its wrong. my question is, do i completely freak out and assume he needs to see a psychologist, or is even something this gross normal ?    if my son had come to me and told me what happened ind be less concerned, but sounds like he would have kept it up had the third child not come forward.the police were called, they agent going to do anything cause they are all the same age, and the teacher who didn see them hiding behind a bench on the playground doing this, will likely be reprimanded but not sure anything more will come of it.as it stands now, ism scared to send him back to school. ism not sure if he was victimized or if he is the 'perp' sort to speak. he said hers never seen such an act, no ones done it to him before and ism a single mother with a tight grip on his life i feel comfortable that hers not been abused or exposed to this prior to this happening.where do we go from here ?

2320,his am 35 with 2 young children (5 and 2) and had a hysterectomy following the birth of my and little boy, my varies were left in place.    march this year my varies were removed due to benign cysts and i am now on hot (eve 75 my i think).    i started on the lowest dose in march and last month was upper to the 75 my dose as i was experiencing really bad mood swing and the hot flushed etc.    i have found my moods are fine now and the hot flushed are much better but i have no sex drive at all.    it really upset me as well, as all i want to do is go to bed and sleep.    my husband is very highly vexed i guess and has no understanding and sex is very important to him, whereas now i couldn care less.    is there anything i can do?    i find i am more just going along with it as i feel so guilty about always being asleep or not interested but it all feels like a pretence and no longer that enjoyable.    i am not dry or anything and it is not painful, it is simply i have no interest in it or enjoyment.thanks
2321,i have a son who is 8 years old and is struggling every day of going off to school, and leaving mon. he does go off with his dad to go fishing, to the store; he stays overnight at his grandparents, for fun, periodically. he says that its easy because he is with family, but to go to school he is leaving me (his mon) and he will miss me. everyday its a battle to get him to school and even for the teachers to get him to do his school work. he continually asks the teacher if he can call his mon. he is in the rd grade this year and in the previous years of grade school, my husband and i have never had this problem with him. i dont know what to do or how to handle the everyday situation? ism afraid he will eventually have a low self-esteem, feeling that his parents dont want him because they are kicking him out the door to school, and that not the case. he has an older brother who is 10 and two younger shillings 7 and 2.
2322,i had a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and appendectomy due to severe endometriosis which had infiltrated my varies and was all over my other organs as well (plus a lot of endometriosis was also removed that had adhered to my bowels, bladder, and appendix) .    to help me avoid radical menopause symptoms, my doctor immediately started me on a .5 my. ville-dot nitrogen patch after surgery, and i felt fine.     two weeks later, he added a 100 my. daily dose of prometrium to my hot therapy to avoid recurrence of endometriosis growth.    my problem is that i am having unpleasant side effects from the prometrium, including exhaustion, minor headache, and lightheadedness.    i dont like how it makes me feel.    what other alternatives would you suggest to the 100 my. prometrium?    can i take a lower dose or cream that would possibly lessen these side effects?    i would prefer to take only the nitrogen, but my doctor is concerned that it could stimulate the growth of endometriosis.    thank you for your feedback.
2323,sorry i was gone for so long. my father spent weeks in the hospital, first for internal bleeding which then led to a heart attack. it was exhausting and long as i drove up to ny and back.i am so glad to be home.my father is doing much better. thank you all for you well wishes and notes!! :)

2325,i have a for old son in the st grade that has some behaviour problems.    he thinks pitching is like playing.    have tried everything i can think of as far as discipline and it has been frustration for me to find a solution.    i dont know how else show him and what else to say to get him to know that it is inappropriate.    when he was 3 i had to deal with the biting and pitching and when i took him to his pediatrician, he stated that he was probably not happy with his environment.    so ever since then he was put in a school with a smaller environment and he improved greatly.    now ism dealing with pitching and not listening since last year when he was in kindergarten.    i know have been told that he is a boy and he is at that age, but i just dont want him to hurt anyone else and i dont want to hear anymore situations from the teachers or parents.    i am a single mother and i know it makes a difference if there is a male figure in his life but this is getting ridiculous.    he is also sometimes a monkey-see-monkey-do.    we all thought he would grow out of it, but i dont know its still going on.    please help, any suggestions is greatly appreciated and accepted. :o)

2328,my boyfriend 9 or old (just barely) touched my 6 or old daughter by squeezing her butt and putting his hand over her vagina.    all of this was over the clothes.    they may have been discussing being boyfriend and girlfriend, and he may have used terminology like i want to sex you up.    my daughter is almost done with her counselling and seems to be fine.    obviously, we dont allow the kiss to see each other anymore.    at my urging, the boy is now going thou his own counselling.    i have a hard time thinking this was just playing doctor due to his age and the areas he was interested in.    my ex-husband called child services and the investigator deemed it child upon child activity with no findings.    he is, however, taking me to court for custody of the children since i did not break up with the boyfriend.    can my ex charge the boy with molestation?    does anyone agree that this seems out of bounds for normal child sexual development?    thanks
2329,we have a 10 or old grandson that is living with us so he can go to our school district.    he has been having bowel movements in the tub, this has not just happened it has been going on for a while.    he is very backward and shy , his mother is divorced and living with someone for about 6 years now.    we have a feeling that he was abused by his real dad when he was about 3-4 years of age.    he was in coinciding for about 2 years, it didn seem to help.i some ways he is very bright, but in other ways i am not sure.    he has to have a routine for things , but we can change it at timeswithout too much trouble.    when he comes in from school the first thing he does is look at the clock and tells me what time it is,to the the exact second.
2330,what causes my 7 or old to be so angry and aggressive towards me his mother and others    lifting his hands and thrashing his room for no reason
2331,a few months ago i noticed a lump on my forehead. it isn painful, actually it gets to be itchy at times. i haven bumped my head or anything and the lump comes and goes. i would feel the lump grow around nighttime but the next day its gone. however this time it looks like its been there for several days and i dont know why. what should i do?
2332,i am strongly against any and all fly vaccines and have been my whole life.    i have never had one nor have my 9 and 5 year old kiss.    well my wife joined the panic bandwagon and just had to get it done.    my son they would only give the nail which made me even more angry.    but the point to my question is that my 9 year old daughter who has cough variant asthma had her shot and 1 hour later she collapsed to the floor and was out for about 30 seconds.    whites in eyes showing.    she came to and the ambulance was pretty much at the house.    they took her to er and they did egg, chest x-rays, blood work and a few other tests.    every thing came back normal and they said she must have just passed out due to anxiety or something due to the shot.    the dr gave me the most political answer when i asked if this could be a side effect to the shot.    she has never passed out in the 9 years she has been around all of a sudden she gets a vaccine and boom.    i just want a honest answer.    because the medical field does not want people to think vaccines are dangerous and when something does happen it seems like they try to hide it to not scare the rest of the community.    any answers would be great.    thank you
2333,doctor, i have followed with interest many comments on the issue of accessory breast in the armpit for more than a year. i have never seen a picture or heard of anyone that has the size of what is under my right armpit. it took a lot of courage to finally write this. it is not a tissue - it is a full breast with no nipple protruding. more than a handful if you tried to clasp. it has grown over a 10 - 11 years period. size kept increasing after my two kiss. i was scared and still am scared what i will be told if i saw a doctor. it does not hurt at all. occasionally    (once every two/three months) i feel some sharp pain but in the right breast not in the accessory. recently, in the last 6 months, i also noticed a lump in the left armpit too - almost the size of a tennis ball. neither of them hurt. i do not consider these a cosmetic issue, i have only chosen to live with them silently out of fear that removing them might lead to complications or my pictures may be spluttered over medical journals....but now i am also worried should they become malignant. i am about oft of and 200lbs. overnight but not fat. about 3 doctors who took a nursery look in the past claimed it was axillary breast tissue and the little bump i feel inside were nipples. but each time i touch both they feel lump. what do i do? sorry for long post...can no longer be silent. thanks.this discussion is related accessory breast tissue.
2334,contemplation a cyst. at the same time dr. does da since laprascopic to remove one ovary that has a 6 cm cyst on it.    ism 55, past menopause, totally asymptomatic, never had kiss.        no cancer in my immediate family, but definitely cardiovas. problems, dementia, and osteoporosis.    have been on hot for 5 years.    after lengthy research, have done a 180 from wanting to just take out both varies and be done with to wanting the doctor even to attempt to conserve the ovary with the cyst on it.        there all sorts of issues that made me change my mind about the ovary removal; main problem with a full cyst., versus a partial leaving the croix, is that the croix may be of benefit to sexual enjoyment.         canst find mention of any other reasons to conserve the croix, but that a good enough reason alone, i think.     anyone with experience/opinion on this?     health downside to conserving croix and removing uterus?    (ism fine with continuing to have annual pass.)

2337,i am supposed to have a slipped lap band.    the up who does the adjustments here in australia said no slip.    the surgeon who does the lap band surgery, said it was slipped and tomorrow i am getting a second opinion about it - is it slipped or not.i am having no symptoms that you would get with a slipped band - pain/problems.i am wondering, is it possible to have a slipped band without pain/complications and if it is replaced, what is the process that you have to go through before/after surgery to get back to eating normal food again.    i have been told two weeks prior to surgery, optifast and two weeks after surgery optifast and then two weeks of pursued food/straw food.    i am not very keen on optifast and the other one i have the dietician had a problem with because it had to be drunk with skin milk - doesn think it will decrease the size of the fatty liver.

2358,i have had irene since december 2010. for the past month and a half i have been experiencing pregnancy symptoms. when i first started having symptoms i took a digital pregnancy test (first response) it came back positive, so i called my of immediately and they got me in right away for a urine test at the office. it was negative, skeptically i went home and took the other test from the box again it came back positive. so again i called the doctor and told them about it, and again they wanted me to come in for a blood test. so i went back and got the blood test. after i had it done i went back home and took another home pregnancy test (first response) this time it was not digital, it came back positive with a very faint line. then i anxiously awaited the phone call from the doctor then next day, finally it came! it was negative!! so being the septic i am, where did i go?? walgreens for two more bands of hats. i took one from each box and both negative. when those came back negative i just stopped thinking about it for a month and now here i am. i have been feeling movement, fluttering?? or maybe just gas bubbles. i also seem to have gained some weight, which could also be from not eating right.. i just dont know!!! i wanted to insist on a ultrasound after both of their tests came back negative, but i figured they already thought i was crazy so i didn call back. so the question is, do you think i could indeed be pregnant?? should i schedule another appointment? or is this all in my head? has anybody reading this had a similar situation and been pregnant? thank you in advance for your time and responses. :-)

2383,hello,first of all, thank you for your time.have recently been diagnosed with spina bifida occulta in my lumbar spine, accompanied by split cord there swell.i also have a low lying bonus medullary due to a tiny bit of fat tissue connected to it at sacral level.i also had a congenital inclusion dermoid cyst in the back of my head (occipital region), which has been successfully removed when i was 2 years old. ism 20 now.have recently had a check-up mr of my head to see if the cyst had come back, but it hadn.but i saw something else on the mr, which got me worrying a bit.its about my cervical spinal cord, it looks as if its going to split there swell. the mr only shows a part of my cervical spinal cord, since its an mr of my head. but it certainly makes it look as if its about to split completely, since the posterior side of the spinal cord is already showing a split, which isn normal i assume?i really think the posterior split of the cervical spinal cord is there, and isn due to me moving or something, because it shows in more than one series (with contrast, without contrast, corona and transverse series).i dont have any symptoms in my hands or arms though (yet). well, the 2 smallest fingers of my right hand are a little smaller than they should be, they also look a tiny bit webbed, but no neurological symptoms.only the split cord of my lumbar spine is causing some -minor- neurological symptoms in my right foot and leg.could you please take a look at the photo i added, and tell me your opinion?should i have an mr done of my cervical spine? please let me know what you think.thank you for your timeblonmp

2385,good evening everyone!i have been desperately searching the web for some hope regarding my diastsis and the associated problems from it. i had back surgery in 2006 after having my son in 2005. i look like i am between 6 and 8 months pregnant and there is a physically visible and unquestionable separation of the abdominal muscles. i have digestive problems and have been on copious amounts of dangerous painkillers so that i can work (against doctors recommendations) through the pain. i feel that my only chance to lose this hanging weight and lack of strength around my middle and get off these pills is to have this surgery. however, i cannot afford to pay for plastic surgery. what are the chances my insurance will pay? i have had a c-section and back surgery (lumbar area) and there is zero muscle tone to hold anything in. i have been put on anti depressants because of all of this and the beds i take (aside from their dangerous nature just because of what they are) cost my insurance between $1,000 and $1200 per month as it is. any advice at all will be so appreciated as i have been depressed and in pain just thinking i was fat and deformed until i read about the diastasis. now i feel there is hope, if i can get my insurance to cover it...i am going to post most of this online as well in the hopes that more people can offer me guidance. thanks again for your time, take care!i want to get my life back; end the pain, get off these dangerous beds, and feel good about myself again. maybe stop being depressed too...?!
2386,well most know that i had an abdominal hysterectomy on november 4. i have had several complications with the incision but for the most part the surgery has gone good and has helped. my incision has gotten infected which was reopened and stitched. few days after the stitches the infection got worse and away more painful yesterday the stitches had to come out because come to find out i am allergic to them and the infection is worse. the incision is very ugly looking and has broken back open again due to the infection, i have to wash it out three times a day and cover it...however i am allgeric to most band-aids and the bandage tape...any ideas what else i could use to cover it when it needs to be covered??
2387,i am 5 weeks post abdominal hysterectomy and now have pain below my belly button, i have several large lumps in my abdominal area that were very bruised right after surgery.    bruises went away, lumps stayed.    and i have pain that starts at the incision sight down the front of my groin area into my right thigh.    plus i have been running a low grade fever for 2 weeks.    spent one of those weeks on augmented.    both the pain around my naval and from my incision down the groin and into the thigh get worse as the day wears on.    is this normal???

2393,i have realized i am extremely sensitive to artificial sweetness but also on a low calorie diet (i know what a curse, hut?) and have been digging up all the research i can on them.found a site called www.splendaexposed.com that pretty much runs the gamutartificial sweetness: this category of non-nutrition, high-intensity sugar substitutes includes aspartame, acesulfame-k, neotame, sucralose, and alitamenow i read this quote on the sitethe two safest choice of sweetness to date are saccharin and stein. yes, saccharin! saccharin is actually similar to stein in its origin.    it originally came from a plant imported from china, and in its original form, is a complex sugar extract from the plant itself.    stein is extracted from a plant grown in south america, and is also a complex sugar extract.i did not know this about saccharin (sweet and low). saccharin was the first type of artificial sweetened developed all the way back in 1878.can anyone confirm/has anyone heard that it is in the same category, safety-wise, as stein?? i had never heard this    the into is from the above site and comes from a book called splendid: is it safe or not? by dr. janet start hull.thanks

2398,i have a low ferritin level and my doctor put me on ferritin.    i called the confounding pharmacist in town to find out if it is available to buy there and they said they have never heard of it.    i called my dr. back and they said that they are the only ones that have it available and i have to buy it in their dr. office (an integration women health office).    i am wondering what the difference is between ferritin and serious glycinate.    i am also wondering if the side effects of the ferritin are similar to the other iron supplement that are out there.    i am also wondering if ferritin is better absorbed with vitamin c and if taking ferritin with calcium can prevent opium absorption.

2409,hi...i just had the lap-band surgery on aug with...so i am 6 days out. each day has gotten slightly better than the one before as far as being able to get liquid down. yesterday was still very slow going. it would take about 3-4 hours to get one 11.5 oz shake down....slowly but surely. well...today i woke up and it seems significantly different. i could drink my shake in about 30 min. i also was able to drink way more water than the prior days combined. i had both and a sugar free jelly cup all before it was time for my next shake. i am just wondering if any of you that have been through this had a point where the change was so major from one day to the next. i am assuming that clot of the swelling went down and it is just going though easier...but couldn hurt to ask. thanks

2415,is it possible????    i had a hysterectomy and after surgery i could not move my bowels for at least 3 weeks!!    the doctor told me that sometimes our organs dont wake up right away after surgery.    well it became worst as weeks and months went on.    i was rushed to the hospital 4 months after surgery, i was having a difficult time breathing.    i was admitted and test were done.    i was backed up with poor, and had to have an enema, which really did not do much.    i then was instructed to drink a gallon of some stuff (that they rep you with to have a colonoscopy).    that was a nightmare, as i was drinking this, i became very bloated and nausea.    it took, 15 hours before i could move my bowels.    a total of 2 days drinking and popping and i still was not cleared out!!    still having trouble moving my bowels, sometimes days before i could go and then a week.    i called a gastro do and he set up a colonoscopy.    i had to rep 2 days before the procedure.    the morning of the procedure i still was not cleaned out!!!!    luck.......still had to have the test.    now come to find out i have clonic interim, but never had problems before the hysterectomy.    i have also been having problems with my left leg (nerve) and 2 small toes going a little numb on me................but again never had this until the hysterectomy!!!!i am a very active person, previously had 3 c-sections and when i was just years old i had to have my right ovary and tube out........due to a cyst that had twisted my ovary.    i have also had 2-3 laporoscopy's.    i know i had clot of scar tissue, but when the gastro do had gone in he said and put it on his report, colon features a sigmoid that is sharply regulated.............only on the left side.    well when i had the hysterectomy all i had left was the whole left side(ovary & tube).    is anyone else experiencing these problems.    i have never gone to a doctor for being constipated until i had the hysterectomy!!!!    is it possible they might have damaged muscle and nerve and the left side of my colon when they performed the hysterectomy????

2427,ism taking 50,000iu vitamin do per week because of my low vitamin d level.within a few days, the following symptoms developed:- extreme thirst that wont go away with fluid- fast heart rate (i could hear hear beating in my ears whole time)- muscle tightness- extreme fatigue (could sleep 24hr if i wanted)- increase in appetite (found this to be good since have always been underweight and not much appetite)so, i did some research and read that these symptoms are caused by magnesium deficiency.    so, i tried high doses of magnesium with vitamin d for a few days and it did not help a bit (even tried topical magnesium oil which is known for best absorption).i also read that these symptoms are caused by high calcium in blood.but, i wanted to try 500mg of calcium just before i give a rest to the recovery due to the extremely uncomfortable symptoms. and within a few hours of taking calcium those symptoms disappear, and i get great energy that i have never felt before.can someone explain why this happens? i thought all those symptoms are from high calcium in blood so i was supposed to avoid calcium and take magnesium instead????? so confused......

2432,why treat nutrition deficiency with drugs?(owns, november 13, 2008) a recent study suggested that stations might be used to avoid the effects of nutrition deficiency. writing in the new england journal of medicine, the jupiter group described a study of station drugs in people with high c-reactive protein and low cholestrol. (1) high c-reactive protein levels are associated with inflammation and heart disease/stroke. the authors concluded that, in apparently healthy persons with elevated c-reactive protein levels, rosuvastatin (creator) significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events.their much-publicized claim, that this station lowers the risk of heart attack by approximately one half, is technically correct though highly misleading. the reported annual incidence of coronary events was 37 people in 10,000 (controls) and 17 people in 10,000 (treated). similar results were reported for risk of stroke. when expressed as a proportion, a 46% improvement (17/37) sounds large. however, an improvement of 20 events (37-17) in 10,000 people known to be at risk is less impressive. such an improvement means that 500 people (10,000/20) with this increased risk would need to take the tablet daily for a year, to prevent one person suffering an event.the paper does not explicitly report deaths. one reason for this may be that if a person on stations suffered a heart attack, that person was about three times more likely to die than a control who was not on stations.the cost of rosuvastatin per person is approximately $1000 per year. so, treating enough people to prevent one heart attack costs $500,000 per year. since about 70% of the heart attacks were not fatal, prevention of a single death from heart attack would cost even more, approximately $1,700,000. giving the benefit of the doubt, we may allow for a similar reduction in stroke and say that only $250,000 is needed to protect one person from a stroke or heart attack. it is hardly surprising that astray zeneca's share price increased by $1.3 billion dollars on release of this paper and the corresponding media hope. (2)the media suggested millions of healthy people could cut their risk of heart disease by taking stations. (3) they also claimed that stations could cut the risk of heart attack for everyone. (4) this is inaccurate and incorrect. the study did not include normal healthy people, only a sample of a relatively small number of people, suffering from inflammation (increased c-reactive protein) - a known cause of heart disease and stroke. out of 89,890 people considered for inclusion, 17,802 people (19.8%) met the specific criterion of poor health for the study. widespread prescription of stations to healthy people is not supported by these findings.the fact that stations produce a modest improvement is surprising, since they are known to lower inflammation, as do many nutrition supplement. as bill said has pointed out, creator lowered c-reactive protein by 37%, but vitamin e lowers it by 32%, (5) and vitamin c by 25.3%. (6,7) these effects are similar to those of stations and would be expected to provide comparable benefits, without side effects and at a lower cost.creator and other station drugs have serious side effects. the incidence of established side-effects, such as rhabdomyolysis (0.3 per 10,000 per year), sympathy (1.1 per 10,000) and peripheral neuropathic (1.2 per 10,000 per year) seems low, (8) but may be underestimated as it takes time to establish long-term side-effects. (the repletion of enzyme que by stations is a particular concern.) the figures imply that for every ten people who avoid a cardiovascular event, at least one previously healthy person will suffer a non-trivial side effect of the station drug.the doctors reported a statistical significant increase (270) in diabetes in the station group compared to the place group (216). over the course of the study, this corresponds to an increased risk of approximately 61 in 10,000 people. so, the number of people on stations reported to become diabetic was greater than the number that avoided a heart attack! these people might have shorter lives and be at greater risk of heart disease in the long term.notably, the jupiter study was stopped early, which the authors admit prevents assessment of how side-effects might outweigh reported benefits in the longer term. the study was to last 3-5 years and the criterion for stopping were not included in the original published design. (9) the paper claims that when the study was stopped these [diabetic] events were not adjudicated by the end-point committee. the committee either knew about the diabetes in which case it was considered, or it did not and the committee was not doing its job properly.the jupiter name stands for justification for the use of stations in prevention: an intervention trial evaluation rosuvastatin; the reader might think this justification sounds more like a marketing plan than a scientific endeavor. the researches did not address the underlying cause of the inflammation and increased c-reactive protein: they simply treated the condition with drugs. in many cases, raised c-reactive protein is a result of nutrition deficiency. (10)it is worth mentioning that several nutrition supplement inhibit inflammation and lower c-reactive protein, without causing known side effects. deficiency in vitamin a, (11) by, c, e, a, late, carotenoids and lycopene, (12) and selenium (for example) is associated with raised c-reactive protein. (13,14,15) we suggest that the $250,000 cost of preventing a single cardiovascular event with rosuvastatin might be better spent funding a study of such expensive alternatives the deficiency of which may be the cause of the problem.the people at risk could be encouraged to supplement their diet and restore their health without using these expensive drugs to conceal their underlying sickness.stick with the supplement!
2433,i have been having re-occuring boils about once every 2 months. it comes, pips then goes away. i went to the doctor and he gave me an antibiotic to help kill off the bacteria that could be causing it. i have already taken one anti-idiotic, and it says to take two every day for two weeks, but after searching, i dont want to use the anti-idiotic anymore and would rather fight it naturally. i am big on tea (green, white, etc.) and try to eat healthy foods. i would go the natural way, but ism now worried that since i took one pill, i am letting whatever bacteria there is build up a resistance to it. should i try to fight it off naturally with nutrition, sleep, and exercise, or keep taking the antibiotic so the bacteria wont become resistant. thanks!

2445,about axillary breast tissue not being a problem post-part / breast feeding; i discovered i had such tissue while pregnant (excessive swelling, pain). when breast feeding, it only got worse. after my daughter was born, we tried in vain to get her to latch on. most of the time, she would not, so formula supplemented her. in the meantime, the extra milk i carried (not going to my daughter) gathered up in my axilla - all the way down to my elbow! (very tough tissue where once was soft); the axilla was swollen so much, it was like a golfball, and i could not lower my arm without tears in my eyes. i expressed what i could for relief (painful to do), but after several weeks, i had to dry up naturally (oh - more pain) to stop the process altogether. talk about post-part depression! we both survived, but now years later, i still have pain and swelling - not as bad of course, but the tissue is the reason. i am definitely going to look up lips or resect surgery. it is time! i would love to go sleepless like i did in my 20's. all the exercise and weight lifting canst alone help this problem...this discussion is related axillary breast.

2452,my sister had a hysterectomy coming up to 2 years this may, an she has never recovered. she has seen countless doctors, an been back for keyhole surgery since, an has never been told exactly what has happened. she is now in a wheelchair, an suffers constantly with unbearable, an only what she can describe as severe pressure pain, and she feels as though she is dragging her stomach behind her. she is now on machine, an a lot of paracetamol. she doesn get any relief hardly with the pain, an cannot do anything at all for herself. it was supposed to be a straightforward hysterectomy, and a large fibroid removed, but this has turned into a nightmare. before she had this op, she worked full time. can you help in anyway. ann
2453,do you know why your dr schedule one set of days as opposed the other. ism on closed 5-9 and have read that there is more success with days 3-7?    just wondering the rational for both.
2454,hey i am a 22 year old white male. i try to lift 4 times a week and run once or twice. i am pretty skinny but have gotten some tone over the past year. i take they protein right after my work out, and occasionally for breakfast as well. i was just thinking about starting creating before lifting and wanted to get some opinions on this. i anna max my results, but in a healthy long-term way. everything i have read is pretty mixed reviews.thanks!
2455,i have always been a very skinny person. i have a super fast metabolism and although i can eat an enormous amount of food i never seem to gain any weight. in fact, its like i actually loose weight. i feel like i am wasting away and there isn a thing i seem to be able to do to make myself get heavier. does anyone know if there are any types of beds i can be prescribed or something to do that can help me get a little meat on my bones?
2456,if people are using marijuana to combat the effects of them i dont understand why anyone would be concerned with long term effects as it would be used ( supposedly ) short term. any drug has negative effects if over used. some would say if doctors are not getting a kick back ( like they do from prescription drugs ) they would be likely to combat any so called home remedy. i think the medical marijuana issue has some merit but the government is to lax on policies the care gives or pushes depending on what side of the fence you are on. in michigan i know that people are his-representing the need to use it;but its a fast growing business in times of economic hard times.
2457,i have a swollen gland in my arm pit that is tender to touch and making my arm and hand swell. should i be worried?

2472,ism a 22 year old female, i weigh 209.5 les currently (weighed 215 les on nov th when i started my diet plan), and ism 5'2'' tall. i now exercise 45 minutes 4 times a week and aiming to every day of the week. when i calculated my mr (according to moderately active since i started exercising and i move a lot at home with my two little kiss), it was 2440.my diet plan is eating 1440 calorie a day, and exercising as mentioned above. i should mention that before starting on nov th, i had not exercised or done anything close to exercising (not even walking, i hardly ever go out since i had my kiss), and i started with 45 minutes of light calisthenics (rousing on as, legs, and arms - trace anderson method for post-pregnancy exercise). i have also noticed that i usually reach only 50% of my needs of calcium, iron, and potassium per day.about a week ago, i started to feel suddenly unable to breath right, not while exercising or after it, just arbitrarily. i just feel like i canst take a good deep breath for a short while and it comes and goes throughout the day. can this be related to my diet or exercising? maybe due to low iron intake? although i have had mild anaemia when i was pregnant, never got it checked again after that and stopped taking iron pills after childbirth. any thoughts?
2473,i had my surgery 4 weeks ago using the da since root. recovery is going well. however, when i left the hospital my thighs had some numbness on the surface and deep pain. the skin feels and looks odd, kind of scale. when i mentioned it to the doctors and nurses, they thought it was due to the nerve irritation when lymph nodes were taken. has anyone else had this type of pain?
2474,about 3 years ago i had a complete hysterectomy. since having my hysterectomy i have experienced pain on my left side, where my varies would be. over the past three months the pain has become more intense and happens more often. i had an ultrasound, but it showed nothing out of the way. do ultrasounds show scar tissue? and if this persists the next step will me be an mr, will that show sharing and if it is sharing what can be done?
2475,i am a 44 year old female who has been on premerin for many years now,,,,all of a sudden i have developed pains in my breasts, like growing pains.    i canst lay on my left side for longer than 20 min. without it killing me.    i had a malo and ultra sound and they both came back normal....does anyone have any thoughts.

2477,this is just a thought have had:     most if not nearly all bacteria live in an acid environment. if the body is too pacific them you become ill.    simple !!!this is quite hard to reverse,    so......     what about the idea mine to wash through the vital organs etc. with an alkaline substance,    for instance.    magnesium.this is similar in substance to the idea of an elson salt cleanse.    (which i do myself)......but perhaps just a simpler version of this may be a good idea for ills.     it seems to make sense to me.any thoughts anyone ??
2478,i am only 11 but everything i eat makes me feel very sick went home sick yesterday and i fell asleep when i got home....its 4 am and everyone is asleep and i canst wake them answers???

2480,i had a total law along with a rectocele and peroneal body repair. its been over 3 months and my stitches at the top of the perineum (bottom of vaginal opening) are still there and very strong. because of this, my husband and i cannot resume sex yet. (did try once and my poor do got cut!    ) i dont think that they are long enough for a doctor to grasp and a thin layer of skin may have healed over the stitches. have heard of stitches not dissolving even after 11/2 years! is that true? if the doctor canst get a hold of them to remove them and they wont dissolve on their own, is there anything i can put on them to help them along? ism having trouble with my insurance company paying for the surgery and surgeon is out of state. therefore, i cannot afford to go to the gun unless i know beforehand that there is something that can be done. any advice?
2481,okay...so have tried so many things in the past to relieve anxiety, and none have helped much...gave up coffee, but then started back up again...which was stupid because it really was helping.as most of you know, i have a doctor induced phobia of taking pills...even the thought of taking verbal supplement scars the daylight out of me because of all the bad experiences have had in the past with meditations. even taking vitamin scars me...silly i know, but...true.anyway...thought its about time to quit smoking as well. have read the literature...i know how bad smoking is...i know it causes anxiety and does not relieve it in any way, shape, or form.now is a very good time to quit because i have the urge to do so. i have been having very bad chest pains for the past week now...not sure if they are anxiety induced or not, but i dont care...i need to stop smoking, and need to do it now!i am reading allen carry easy way to stop smoking ( which someone on here suggested about a year or so ago)...other methods have failed me miserable.allergic to the tape on the patches, canst chew gum, keep swallowing the lozenges, etc.allen says in his book that there should be no added anxiety when trying his method...but for those who have a preexisting anxiety condition? ism not so sure.anyway, have heard that certain smells can alleviate anxiety. i know this to be true to a degree, because the smell of avoids soft pink bubble bath always used to make me feel soooooooo good....i would relax and fall asleep just smelling it.but of course, like all good things, they took it off the market because they needed to make room for new    ( nasty smelling  who ) aroma...at least that the excuse they give when you call them or write to them.so...anyone know of any other nice smelling products or such that may help?lavender doesn cut it with me anymore...makes me caseous and gives me headache now.canst even drink the lavender tea...which used to help.there are many essential oils out there, but not sure which would be the best...also not sure of exactly how to use them. do you put them on your skin? in a pot of boiling water?thanks in advance to all.

2556,a couple of weeks ago, one of my teeth got sensitive to cold.    it got to the point that drinking tap water or breathing in quickly would hurt.    it wouldn last long, maybe a second at most.    it was still this way last night when i went to bed.    all of a sudden this morning, it was fine.    i even held ice cream against it tonight and there was no pain whatsoever.    just the slight discomfort of holding something really cold on your teeth.    i thought i might have had a lecky filing or a bad tooth but why would that just stop hurting all of a sudden?    what going on?

2563,hi! i am 38 years old. i am 5'7 and weigh 123 les. i exercise everyday and i am a high school teacher. i have been suffering from the following symptoms for the past 3 years : burning constantly after eating, feeling of solid food getting stuck in my throat, sensation of excessive mucous in my throat after eating. i basically use a juice, eat smoothed and very soft foods. i feel like i have a 90 year old diet!    i have been to went and 2 different gastro days . i was told it was herd and put on medium was a day for 8 months with no relief. then, tried zengrid and prevail with no relief. had upper endoscopy with dilatation that helped for a few months, then symptoms returned. the second gastro dr. seemed at a loss as to why medium would not work and why his dilatation during endoscopy did not work. i am now seeing a different gastro dr who will do a mobility test next week. i am well educated and not imagining these symptoms. i even had an went tell me to just take a muscle relevant to eat! this seems ridiculous, since i am able to eat soft foods and liquid.i am very frustrated that every doctor i see has a different opinion. do you have any advice? all of the gastro doctors seem frustrated that nexus does not work. have you had other patients with these symptoms? the only meditation i take is .88 levoxyl for thyreoid. incidentally, all of my issues stated 3 months after starting levoxyl. every dr. i have been to said it is not related, but i would like your opinion. thank you for your help!
2564,these boards have been very helpful and i would like to thank those for their helpfullness!i have develop a solid mass/nodule (5.7x3x3.7 on last u/s) with calcification taking up pretty much my whole left thyreoid love.    i have three other small ones also, though, those were not biospied.    the tipsy came back benign but with follicular cells within it with the pathologist stating further investigation is warranted pending clinical appearance.    my interest had sent me to a surgeon urgently for a surgical consult for removal of my thyreoid gland and the went surgeon was resistant and wanted to wait a month as he thought i had acute choroiditis.    my interest very much disagreed.    i have had 2 ultrasounds, 1 it scan w/contrast and now this week i am having a thyreoid take to determine if it is a hot/cold/warm nodule.    my internist's office had called last friday and stated that when they retrieve the results of this scan they want to see me regarding seeking consultation from an endocrinology surgeon in another province (we dont have one).    i am not treated with any meditations either.now my questions: could it be cancer even if it is a hot nodule?    is calcification that bad and does it always lead to cancer?    if the occurrence is rapid does this lean towards cancer?    can an fan determine noncancer/cancer follicular cells?i know it is a lot of questions, but i just want to have some sort of sense before going back to the interest.thanks, and......merry christmas!
2565,my baby is 4 years old.    on friday evening after his bath, i noticed a rash in his face (very, very fine bump).    upon further examination, i noticed that this rash was covering his trunk along with his arms and upper legs.    before he got in the bath, i did not notice any rashes, although i did not inspect him at the time.    the rash, at first, did not pitch.    but now it seems to pitch him.    what should i do?
2566,hello,i had posted question here a several times before and each time really helped me...i thanks you for then and.i thank you in advance.around dec. of last year i had a few protected oral sex with a street hooker.    we smoked come and i received oral for a few hours.    that next day,    i felt this burning , tingling feeling that i had not felt before.    then i notice the rim of my penis turn red , with a few red spots.    i went to the clinic ,    and the doctor said everything looked normal, and all my tests were negative.    then a month later,    mid jan.    i noticed a small white bump on the bottom tip of my penis.    i tried to squeeze , pop, pitch , and just made it worse.    there was a ll pus ..but hardly no liquid of any type....it got infected and turned really red and looked like a bad pimple, then in about a week..it disappeared leaving a tiny little black dot.    i then went to the clinic again...did all the test again...( negative)...and the doctor told me that everything was normal it was just the way my skin was.    relief!.around early feb.a month later     i noticed a red spot, on the bottom part of the head...right about the rim.    it want even a bump because i couldn feel anything. but it was fairly big...size of pen cap...maybe al ll smaller.     so for about a month i just had a red spot that was so slightly raised. sometimes you have to have the    light shine    to really see it..the red spot alone had this shine/gaze to it..     it didn pitch or hurt and had no feeling.    i was hoping this would just go away....but i have had this since it started and now it seems worse. now the red dot are really noticeable and when i masturbate i can even feel some sort of scab.     as i looked at it carefully it even seems like a lesion or blister.this last weekend i had a encounter for only oral sex which was protected.    then i did a lot of masturbating with lotion the burning and tingling feeling appeared again.    i would constantly look at my penis because there is some discomfort, ism not sure if its burning or tingling, or it could be both....there even some weird pain on the tip of the penis....and a stinging feeling on the shaft and seems like my testicle hurt too. today i spent about a hour examining my penis.....1.    that red spot that been there for many weeks is now looking like a    lesion , blister.    2. the shaft of my penis when flaccid has lots of wrinkled skin and when erect i noticed a few spots where the skin is gone. .    kind like a fraser burn....or a ulcer but not discoloured in any way.    could this be from masturbating...( i have noticed that my penis is sometimes dry and sticky. ).    3.    i feel burning/itching    on the penis.    i canst really pinpoint where the discomfort is coming from but when ism sitting down , driving,    it feels like the whole penis has been dipped in ben gay.scar thought of having steps is taking over my days.    i would read 100's of post on the forms and i would read many articles online. ism afraid that i caught something now.....i will go in to see the clinic again but wanted your advice and thoughts about this.     thanks

2570,hi there, newby here... here the background into:been on percocet pain pills for bad knees, one which i had surgery on, and the other ism putting off for awhile.    have been taking them for over 2 years.    a little less than a year ago, i started abusing them badly and worked up from 2 to 3 my. per day to up to 90mg (was taking 3 30mg of roi or ox or pus, whatever i could get my hands on)... in the last couple of months have been able to taper to 25 to 35 per day, but now my life is in stables, specifically with finances, and i have to clear my head and get my drive and motivation back to get into the workforce again and take my life back.yesterday, i took my last my (that all i took) and it was at 1:00... today will be the first day without anything and i dont know what to expect.    ism already starting to freak out a little bit, my body hurts, and ism super 'touchy'. i feel like i could fly off the handle at anyone today.my question is, what should i be expecting over these next few days, and what can i do to alleviate symptoms as to not drive my entire family crazy.    i have 3 kiss and i need to keep sanctioning with daily activities...thank you for your advice!
2571,i have had a stingy burning like pain under the nipple around the areola for quite some time. this week i developed a very sharp stinging pain that feels deep inside the left breast. i examined and found that there is a bruising type of sign under the nipple and an indentations. the stinging is very localised and very painful. my left breast is much larger than the right, always has been and when i am sitting at a table, the breast pushing against it, i can feel a aching there. there is    a pimple like mole that has developed also. any ideas?
2572,hi, i am 35 years old and have had 3 children, one has passed away due to congenital heart disease, which could have been due to my uterus. i have a bicornuate uterus-heart shaped-(which i just found out about, a small fibroid (2 cm), heavy long periods with a brown mucus discharge, painful intercourse, bad headache during the end of my periods and horrible lower back pain. i went to my obey for several years with complaints and she never did tests or anything on me, so i just switched doctors and she have been running tests on me. the ultrasound showed heart shaped uterus and a fibroid. she also did a test to check for cancer which was negative. she said that i could possibly have endometriosis. she said my option are irene (mud- used as birthcontrol) or a hysterectomy. the pill is out due to past issues with headache and the pill. so we talked about trying the irene first to see if that would help me, but i am have second thoughts about it. the more i read about it the more it makes me wonder. like it is mainly used for birth control, not problems with periods. i am not having any more children and my husband has had a vasectomy, so i dont need to worry about birth control. also does it work with a heart shaped uterus? then do i want to feel better for a few years then have the same problems again later with the same option? with the irene it will make your periods heavier before they get lighter, what fun! has anyone else had the same problems or used a irene for the same reasons? should i try the irene first or just get a hysterectomy? thanks.. dsmegnky
2573,we took les to the hospital today to get a small port    for her pain beds and fluids.    i have finally came to terms with this , i am as prepared as possible. she is alert and they are keeping the pain down. i can see when it hits her, first her hands start to move around trying to scatter the pain, then she becomes very restless, then her face starts showing    how intense it is. the pain medicine only takes a few minutes to take affect, but it is enough for me to see how bad it is for her.    she sat for an hour holding hands with chris today, her brother with down, that seemed to help, she is still eating solids and taking a stool softer daily.    we will take her home thus or fro,    her 3 brothers that have gone canning    up north called her today, when then found a hill they could use the cell from.    that seemed to help also, they will be home sunday. my car gave out on me today, some bolt let loose and the transmission fell down,    i had the corps and a wrecked to help me.    i will be staying all night with her 3 times a week from now on, at home, i only cry when i pass places in town that meant so much to us.    i do not want any one to feel sorry for me, and i am sorry to see that some of you    are hurting and some that are just starting this journey, it isn all bad, there are many good days.    live every day to the fullest and laugh clot, les and i laughed today and it felt so good.     more later    mary

2586,hi.    this is the third time in the past year that i have gone cold turkey off of klonopin.    each time the dose that i withdrew from has been less....first time, 3 my, second time, 2 my, this time, 1 my    each time the first several weeks are agonizing, but the end result lasts for many months at a time.    the only reason i went back on klonopin at a lower dose, with a doctor, has been major external stressors, post traumatic stress disorder to be exact due to an abusive relationship.    now, the withdrawal symptoms are much easier to handle than the first few times, but still difficult to get through.    do you have any suggestions for staying off of klonopin for good without going back to my prescribed dose first?

2589,http://firstread.msnbc.man.com/news/2012/06/07/12105658-team-money-rec-announce-raising-nearly-77-million-in-may?litejust hours after the drama campaign announced that it, the democratic national committee, and other drama-related committees had naked in $60 million in may, team money said they one-upper them.their money campaign/republican national committee haul: $76.8 million. they also reported having a combined $107 million in the bank for all of their committees.  we are encouraged by the financial support from a broad range of voters, money victory national finance chairman spence wick said in a statement. voters are making an investment because they believe that it will benefit the country.  but if the financial reports from april are any indication, much of that nearly $77 million is coming in the form of big five-figure checks from large donors.around this same time last month, the money camp and rec reported raising a combined $40 million. but when we saw the actual federal election committee filing, it was $11.7 million for the campaign, $11.4 million for the rec, and the rest -- $17 million -- for the money victory fund.the money victory fund -- which also includes coordination with the state goes of id, ma, ok, and it -- is the mechanism that allows donors to contribute up to $75,000 each. in mid-may, both mist money and his wife each contributed $75,000 to the victory fund.there is also an drama victory fund, which allows large donors to cut equally big checks. but when team drama announced raising $43.6 in april, the few filing later showed that the campaign raised $25.7 million, the duc raised $14.3 million, although nearly half of that duc money came from a transfer from the drama victory fund.(when team drama collects large checks, the first $5,000 go to the campaign, which is the individual maximum; $30,800 go to the duc, which is the max; and the rest go to the other committees.)we will not be able to get a campaign vs. campaign or party vs. party comparison on these numbers until june 20, when few reports for may are due

2591,about 2 years ago i had an ovarian cyst on my left ovary that leaned into my abdomen causing intense pain. my of/gun monitor the size of the cyst for about a month with little change. again the cyst leaned and this time my of/gun told me to meet him at the hospital to do immediate surgery to drain the cyst. when i woke from surgery my doctor informed me that i did in fact have endometriosis. he immediately put me on depot proverb and i remained on that for close to a year then i switched over to a seasonal birth control. i got my period once every 3 months. recently, with in the last 3-4 months, i often to go off of birth control and hopefully manage my symptoms with naproxen.i get relatively bad cramps and lower back pain around my period and i have had some occurrences of pain during intercourse if i am close to my period. i guess after i was diagnosed i never really read up much on the actual cause and complications of endometriosis. (my sister worries more about me having it then i do).i defiantly want to have kiss one day, ism only 22, but birth control makes me feel like i am a crazy person. does anyone have any other remedies or meditations that have worked to keep endometriosis from advancing.also when i was diagnosed my doctor never gave me a stage. i am going to see him mid february so i will ask him if he knows my stage then and if the stage can effect the effects of endometriosis.

2595,over the past few months have had constipation frequently. fortunately, bowel movement always resumed within 1-2 weeks. recently, i got constipated once again. through the past three weeks have been constipated. sometimes i would get some bowel movement, but then i would be constipated once more within a day. this went on until the middle of last week. that was when i began to get diarrhoea. i got the urge to use the restroom often during the school day but was often forced to simply ignore because we are busy in all my classes getting school work turned in and studying for exam, so i went to the bathroom when i got home. on saturday (yesterday) my diarrhoea began to turn from typical to very watery. it also burned quite a bit as i used the restroom. coloration, however remained dark. i would say that i used the restroom about once every thirty minutes to an hour and was not comfortable getting too far away from the toilet seat. also it should be noted that after every bathroom run i still felt as if i needed to use the restroom but couldn, almost as if there was some type of blockade or still some constipation. today i continued to follow this pattern however the coloration of my stool liquid lightened significantly, from a dark color almost to a an. also i noticed that it want nearly as pacific. in addition to this i suffered from severe gas all day. even now my abdomen continues to rumble. at one point during the day i could not release the pressure building up in my abdomen and i had sharp gas pains in my abdomen. i struggled to pass gas and could even feel the gas bubble sliding down and then moving back up as i applied and released pressure. also just a side note, i did not use the restroom nearly as often today, maybe only five or six times. i am bewildered by this entire occurrence and    really dont know what to think. please enlighten me.

2602,my husband is a 29 year old african american who has been experiencing serious episodes that are occuring in clusters.    by this, i mean that last year about 7-9 months ago, he experienced symptoms for a few weeks.    it starts by him feeling more tired than usual, then hell start having muscle pain, headache.    what eventually happens then are the episodes, his back pain gets intense, intense chest pain, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, numbness and weakness in all of his limbs, cold/numb mouth, red bloodshot eyes, headache, flurry vision.    also about 6 months ago, he developed a lingering cough.    after an episode he is not himself at all, meaning fatigue, ache, frequent pangs in chest.    after a couple weeks (i dont remember how many times he got the attacks) the symptoms went away.    his cough developed but nothing else until a couple weeks ago; hers been extremely tired lately then last week he had two of the attacks.    during the second and last attack he had, i took him to the er.    they didn find much but did find elevated up results (530), slightly high urine oh (7.5), slightly low lymphocytes (23).    other than this, he has a slightly low heartfelt according to an egg.    we were fortunate enough to see a cardiologist today, they dont think its related to his heart based on these and other results from the er, however they are doing one last ekcocardiogram.    he thinks we should try neurology as well and agrees that its only persistence that will find us an answer.

2609,i am mayo and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism about eyes ago. that was a very dark period in my life because i had been going through all kinds of moodswings and irritability. i was in and out of hospitals and doctor offices, only to be told that i had anxiety. at first i thought i did because i was very stressed out but the way i was acting, i knew that it want my normal self. i really wish that i could explain how hopeless and careless and sad i felt. life seemed really cold and dark to me, i became deeply depressed. it seemed like i had no one to turn to.i remember one day i was sitting down at home on the computer and all of a sudden, my heart started beating so fast. i immediately called 911 because i thought that i was having a heart attack (i didn know at the time that your heart stops beating if its a heart attack because i was careless about what it was) i was scared out of my mind. anyway, i was taken to the er and to make a long story short, they was so interested in me taking drugs tests instead of trying to help calm my nerves and fears. from what i remember, my heart beats were about 160. as i now am aware, that kind high, but i remember a nurse telling me that day that at my age i could handle it. i remember pulling off those chest sticks and walked out.if only i had known better, i would have stayed and let them (if they would have) run some thorough tests to see what the problem was, i would probably have saved myself more suffering and feel better today.so, to fast forward to today. i eventually ended up receiving a ran 131 scan to confirm hyperthyroid. the results said that after 24 hours, i had an take of 83%, which confirmed graves diseases. i was put on methimazole, which made me pitch all over and become more irritated. i then started taking benadryl, which made me so tired. my life was a mess. i couldn function for school or work. ism telling you, this disease had (and still do)me on some kind of bodily roller coster.the doctor that i have been seeing for this condition is not an endocrinologist and had little knowledge of this condition. its unfortunate that i had no way to see an endocrinologist because my insurance dont cover specially care. however, ism at the point that ism willing to go into debt because of my health. right now, ism really interested in a natural approach to stopping this dis-ease.i really hope someone has taken the time to read what i wrote up to this point but if not, i will not stop trying to get to the bottom of what causing my condition. i know that it doesn run in my family and so, it had to be something wrong i did internally. have read that stress could trigger this condition, and it makes me wonder if its the reason as i was robbed not even a year before my symptoms surface. i have also had a root canal done, which have been giving me problems since.some into about what meditations i taking now is methamizole 10mg about 4 times a day. my th is 0.05, to is 8.5, to is 0.93--i try to limit meals with too much sodium and drink plenty of water. oh, and eat more fruits and veggies. i really dont know what else to do besides this.someone please give me some kind of advice about what to do, or referral to politic, natural doctors that have expertise with this condition. please!here are some of my lab results up to this point:9-24-2007 th ~0.01 (sadly, my first primary care doctor never told me about an abnormal reading when i was tested prior to this one. she said because of my age, she thought ind work itself out)12-27-2007 th~0.05, free to~1.359-04-2009 th~0.05, to~ 8.0, to~0.93, bc~ 9.86, rec~ 5.55, he~ 15.1, platelets count 2529-20-2009 th~ 0.05, to~pending, to~ 8.5, glucose 78

2624,hello,i have not been diagnosed yet with anything but my gun is sending me for a thus tomorrow after months of pain and crazy symptoms.    i am 27, turning 28 next month.starting back in march, i had intense pelvic pain that came and went (very sharp  thought it might be appendicitis but then it went away a couple of hours later and i didn  t seek treatment for it).    over the next few months, just very tired, intermittent random sharp pains on right side, sometimes low in the pelvic area other times higher up by my rib cage, bloated, feel disgusting after eating, cramps and diarrhoea, sometimes pain during intercourse  does not seem to have any obvious trigger.    pain was very bad one night in july, woke me up in the middle of the night, and husband took me to the er  they tested me for appendicitis and kidney stones with at cat scan, everything came back okay, but they told me i had a tumor on my liver and to follow up with pp.    pp did liver function blood tests and sent me for an mr (all the while telling me that he thinks i have is but he needs to rule out everything else before making that official diagnosis).    blood work came back normal, mr showed liver haemangioma which do says could not be causing my pain and i should not worry about it, but will have to have another mr done in a year to make sure it has not changed at all.    the entire month of july i felt sick every single day, husband and i took a weekend trip to chicago, on the ride there i thought we might have to pull over and find a hospital because the pain in my lower back and right side was so intense and i felt very sick (lighthearted, caseous).    symptoms came and went.    pp told me to see my gun.    saw gun, did pp (came back fine), pelvic exam, she said everything felt ok during pelvic exam, but i was in a lot of pain during it, especially when she pressed on area right below where she said my varies are.    she ordered the thus which i am having done tomorrow.    she seemed generally unconcerned about my symptoms due to my age.two weeks ago i started having chest pains, shooting pain in my neck and shoulders (have had this issue before, last year, pp sent me to a cardiologist who did a full work up and told me i was fine but i might or might not have small vessel disease, so basically he told me nothing) and went to the er where i had an episode while hooked up the monitor heart rate went up to 180 in about a minute while i was just sitting there, felt like i was going to pass out, doctor and nurses ran in, stuck an oxygen tube up my nose, gave me beds through iv to stop me from shaking, the whole thing was extremely scar.    they admitted me to the hospital, kept me on heart monitor, did blood work, and an echocardiogram, told me i am suffering from sat episodes and put me on a daily beta blocked (which drops by by low so now i have to worry about not passing out).    released me after 3 nights, now i have a follow up appointment on nov st with the cardiologist.    beta blocked seem to be helping so far, just have to watch my by and make sure i keep my fluid intake up and eat enough.i was just getting over the sat hospital stay when last week, on wednesday night, i woke up with intense pain on my left side, low abdomen area, not quite ovarian area, more to the outer left side.    was shake and sweat, husband took me to the er.    told them i was ordered a pelvic u/s by my gun that i had not had yet, they told me it was too late at night for the u/s, so the doctor (who was male and seemed dismissive) sent me for a cat scan to look for kidney stones, which came back fine, but they said they found a little bacteria in urine and i had a slight ti (doctors exact words were very dismissively   i don  t know what that is about, we  ll give you some antibiotics).    gave me antibiotics through iv, discharged me, husband had to pull over on the way home from hospital because the beds made me sick.    oh and the er nurse also blew out my vein while trying to take blood (went and got a and nurse who did it fine without any problems).    needless to say that er visit was a nightmare.so now i  m sitting at my desk at work with dull constant pain on the right side, thinking to myself that it  s probably nothing (since that is what they tell me at the er usually) but also i worry,   well what if one of these times it is my appendix and i ignore it?  all of this these past six months has been extremely emotional draining.    the pelvic/abdominal pain is scar enough, and so frustration that i do not have a diagnosis, and now also dealing with the sat and heart episodes.    my job has not been understanding and basically told me if i didn  t apply for felt i would be fired.    my husband has been great and very suppurative, but i know he feels the burden too of all of this and try to be strong for me.i don  t know what i want to happen tomorrow  i  m almost hoping that the thus finds something so that i have an answer as to what is causing all of these problems.    on the other hand, i don  t want it to find anything.    hopefully if it does find something it isn  t something too serious (cysts) and can be treated easily.    i know that over is rare in women my age (at least that is what people tell me).    if it finds nothing then i have to see a i specialist and undergo more tests.    i just want answers, tired of not being taken seriously, tired of missing time from work, tired of worrying, tired of doctors and hospitals, tired of feeling like ism nuts.     every day i have some sort of pain, whether it is dull and ache, sharp and stabbing, etc.    i  m so scared that someday i  m just going to drop dead because i have some condition that has gone diagnosed.thanks for listening.    wondering if any of you ladies had any similar experiences or pain like mine, or if any of you are around my age?
2625,to everyone that experiences sleep paralysis, i have read all of your post and i wanted to share my expense once with yours.first, it always happens to me in the afternoon, i have never felt it at night time. i love tapping and today i had a horrible migrate and i just wanted to lay down for a little bit. i can always feel it when is coming and i try waking up. it feels like someone injecting me with anaesthesia and you trying to fight it.i usually feel someone laying behind me and i start to feel goosepumps all over my body. i can also hear voices but i dont know what they r saying.the room temperature becomes really really cold and i start to pray but the noise become louder,now my question is why is it, that when    my dog slept with me it never happen. and the times that has happen my dog is not around, my dog passed away about 2 weeks ago and now in experiencing it    frequently.is: i can swear to you i felt people screaming from hell. i felt agony and when i finally got my body to move i started to cry... my migrate is worst.thank you

2628,ism not stranger to ovarian cysts. big ovarian cysts. the other night when i went to the er and had an u/s done, they discovered ovarian cysts on both varies, the gall bladder looked normal, and most importantly....the gestational and york sacs were in the uterus not in the the tubes. since i had that u/s, the pain has worsted and lowered. it is in the area of my varies and much lower into the pelvic area. this pain now feels like have been sucked punched 100 times in that area. very tender. it feels different (worse) than the pain have felt with cysts in the past.my of had my beats drawn yesterday as a follow up to my er visit, but i didn see him to mention the pains. ism wondering if something worse is going on (though ism not sure what it would be) or if ism just feeling particularly duchy from the vaginal u/s poking around in there. or maybe this is normal for a and pregnancy fresh after surgery. not sure. any insight?i feel like one of those psychic posters that posts the same thing 10 times just to get an answer. really, ism not. ll
2629,for the last 5 weeks i have had a redness on the tip of my penis on both sides which seems to get worse if it gets rubbed or after a shower.    about 2 weeks ago near the area i developed small brown marks which look like bruises also on both sides, not too noticeable but they are to me.    i went in for st testing after the oral sex incident which was right before the redness started showing up and all results came back (-) but he want tested.    i went to the doctor this week and had him look at what i am describing and he said it may be from physical activity or such and said he doesn think it is anything and not to worry.    there was also some redness below the redness on the tip leading into the shaft.    i haven had any pain, blisters etc... no burning during privation although a couple weeks ago i amy have felt the urge to private more often for some reason.    any idea on what this could be and why it is lasting so long?    this would now be 1 month and 1 week with symptoms and it is driving me completely crazy and greatly effecting me.

2637,his was diagnosed with bordering ovarian cancer---it is not a mutinous or serous, it is a    endometriod(sorry spelling)cell after removal of my left ovary.    it was only 1 cm and missed by 2 pathologist but then diagnosis by a university hospital, i went as saw a gun/on who sent it to john hopkins that actually almost missed it, but confirmed the diagnosis.    you get clot of mixed information about this diagnosis and part of me feels that having a hysterectomy is going over board, but there is no studies out there about just observing it and how many get it back if they dont have the hysterectomy.i have some people say i wouldn have a hysterectomy---you will never be the same again---sex, organs, memory problems, mood swing.i know i am fortunate that this is not actual invasion ovarian cancer---and i feel blessed that i dont have that.    i actually went on another web site for ovarian cancer and the women there actually were telling me i was self center and should be thankful that i am alive.    please dont get me wrong i am thankful and i think god has bless me, but i am so afraid of surgical menopause what it will do to me---i have 3 kiss under 5 years of age!i guess i just want to hear that just like childbirth that things are not quite physically but still things work. does that make sense?than for listen

2640,hello!over the past few years, i have begun to eat in my sleep.    this started off to be a rarity or a luke about 3-4 years ago but as of recently its become more frequent in a few times a week. ism also experiencing nightmare and dealing the phone in my sleep and bad headache.my biggest concern is the eating in my sleep because it can cause me harm if it gets worse. this started off as a joke or a minor irritation and now its embarrassing and makes me feel like a pig.    ism also always exhausted because of not ever getting a good night sleep or feel well rested.i frequently will remember waking up in the middle of the night but not remember why i ate what i choose or going back to sleep.    my snacks are often chips, or salt crutch items and a lot of them, in a half bag. if there is left over penza or mexican food i am likely to eat that. have gotten up in the morning still with food in my mouth and have found snacks in my bed or empty bags of snacks on my floor. have tried to not keep the food in the house or hide it or create obstacles like shutting the door to my bedroom or child drooping a cabinet and it doesn seem to work.    do you have any advice?    if i keep up like this, ill never fit into my wedding gown! or keep my job!thanks!
2641,i am a mother of 4 my first ultrasound on 2/22 and all was a empty sac my lip 12/28 could it b early
2642,i have also experienced cataplexy for years.    it started at about age 11-13 and mainly only occurred during extreme laughter.    i actually thought i must be weird or stupid so i never really started talking about it to doctors until i found out it was a symptom of narcolepsy.    i was sent to a sleep doctor and did a sleep study and they ruled out narcolepsy.    basically, the sleep specialist doctor told me i dont know why you would have cataplexy if you dont have narcolepsy and i felt like she was implying that in making it up or something.    yeah like i would make up something that weird or like i would even know something like that existed if i want experiencing it.    it can be very scar. so, no one ever followed up with me.    i get it sometimes when in sleeping too like all of a sudden in conscious but i can move and i even feel like in dying in my sleep because its so paralyzing.    i had a recent episode this morning that reminded me of all the times this has happened to me in the past.    i just got up from bed to let the cat out of the bedroom because he was scratching on the door to wake me up.    i got up, went to the door, opened it, let the cat out, shut the door and then i lost all function in my body, went paralyzed and fell to the floor and broke a statue sitting on the dresser that i hit on the way down.    it only lasted a second but it can be so distressful not to know what wrong with me.    its also distressful to have all the doctors i have talked to about it tell me that in crazy or just dismiss it like nothing is wrong with that.    so my question is do i follow up with this or just dismiss it?    i dont have the money to keep throwing away on doctors that ignore me.this discussion is related tocataplexy without narcolepsy.
2643,since yesterday i have been having abdominal pain that not going away. i plan on calling my doctor tomorrow. any insight from anyone as to what it could be would be appreciated. i had a back on monday. i know in my discharge instructions it says to call if this happens. but ism just curious as to what it is and why i may be feeling this.also where the episiotamy stitches are is it supposed to be puffy or flat?
2644,ism 20 years old and have been experiencing constant nausea for about 14 months...my doctor sent me to a gastroenterologist who did an upper endoscopy and said everything looked fine. then finally, just about a month ago, they discovered that i had a large ovarian cyst (14 x cm), which i had surgery for two and half weeks ago; he also had to remove a small part of my ovary. obviously i thought after the cyst was gone, the nausea would go away, but it hasn!i am wondering if i could have some type of harmony balance? it seems like that could be linked to having the cyst, and i know my mon had balance problems when she was my age- and she also had a cyst just like mine. have always had heavy periods, but i didn think it was a big deal as long as i had them regularly. lately have been feeling lighthearted and kind of like ism not fully awake, even though ism getting plenty of sleep. i expected to get my period a few days ago, but because of the surgery i might skin a month anyway.ism going to my surgery follow-up apt on thursday and ism looking forward to seeing what the gynecologist has to say. would i likely have to go to an endocrinologist if i wanted to get my mormons tested? i guess an endocrinologist would be the next person i would want to see anyway if the no canst find the problem. i was just wondering if anyone knew anything about this! if anyone has experience with this ind appreciate the input! thanks :)
2645,i was wondering if anyone had taken sarasate suspenssca for a stomach ulcer.    my doctor prescribed this meditation for me yesterday, so i have just started taking it.    how long does it take to be effective?    i understand it is an 8-week treatment.    i certainly hope it starts to help soon as i have been miserable for the past few days.

2654,i bit my tongue two days ago...now it is hurting in the place of the bite as there is a huge white cancer sore at the same place i bit it...also on the same side, there seems to be 3 or 4 bump on my tongue about 1 cm away frothy bite. there is no pus coming out though. is my tongue infected?also, i bit my tongue while having lunch, then at night after about 10 hours i felt a pain in my neck under the jaw on the same side of the bite...the next day i woke up and the pain in my neck/throat was worse and i couldn swallow easily. now it is easing a bit. is this related to the biting incident?
2655,i had a spot come up on my lower back a few years ago, that recurred infrequently-maybe 3 times.    always in the same spot, small blisters.    it hasn occurred in at least 8 years.    i recently tested positive for he-2 and my of suspects the spot on my back is actually herpes.    have never had any cold sores, fever blisters, etc. on my mouth or generally.    ism in the process of beginning a new sexual relationship and this, naturally, has caused some concern.    can you give me any advice?    thanks so much.

2657,my partner and i had sex three times during the week that i lobulated (mind you i want aware that i did). we used condemn each time. two of the three times that we did it he ejaculated outside, and we considered it safe. but the third time that he pulled out, the london broke (while it was coming out) and the ejaculated pretty much went all over him (but not me). my period is about two days late now- i wonder if i could be pregnant because of that?
2658,has anyone else experienced these symptoms?    around week six i started clearing my throat (especially at the end of the day).    what did you do?    thanks.    mike.
2659,i am 56 years old, recently had a cough for 2 months and was told it was a touch oh phenomena after a chest gray and was put on to antibiotics.and chest gray was not improved and showed fluffy bits and lumps and bump which they thought could be to.next i went for a cat canteen they took samples from my lungs to grow them.results are inconclusive, they say they dont know what wrong with me and i am being referred to mediastinoscopy and they say that are not looking for cancer at this times anyone any idea what i might have ?
2660,have ever, or regularly, masturbate in order to prime yourself before intercourse??this might seem like a silly question, but to me, and i would assume to most men, the idea seems a bit odd, if only because the end result would be a negative one for most guns who might try this tactic. i dont mean masturbating until you get off. that would make a little sense for a guy who might want to last longer, to masturbate shortly beforehand, since the second one always takes longer than the first.ism talking about just masturbating enough to get yourself ready, i suppose?? i mean, if i did that, it would be horrible for my wife because i would be ready to explode in no time after getting started (which can already be an issue as it is).but i do know you ladies are different in terms of sex and reaching organs, so i could see where it makes sense. so again, do you normally do this? or do you at times, depending on the situation? or is the idea of this just as preposterous to most women as it seems to a man?? let me know...

2664,here goes...hopefully this forum provides me some support or at least one person that may be going through the same thing i am.ism 34 years old and i feel like i have the body of an 80 year old. in 2007 i broke my left ankle and had to wear a walking boot for approve. 8 months. during that 8 months i started experiencing tremendous pain in my right hip. originally it was diagnosed as trochanteric bursitis. i had a osteoid injection and that didn help the pain. i then had an mr and it was determined that i had the beginnings of an in that hip which was more than likely caused by about 10 years of oral steroids for asthma when i was younger. anyhow...the pain continued and i endured multiple osteoid injections, anti-inflamed patches, dreams, anti-inflamed pills, tens unit...you name it, have tried it.last january i lost my job and i make too much on unemployment to qualify for healthcare assistance (its a great group to be in let me tell a! ll) so i was unable to go to any docs for my hip and i decided i would just suffer with the pain until i could no longer stand it. during this time i also moved to another city....sooooo last month i could barely walk. the pain is in the right groin, the front of the hip, the buttock and when i lay down my entire leg aches. i decided to go to a new do up here. i explained everything i had been through as far as treatment on the hip. do you know what his suggestion was?? a breaking injection! ll. this one was to be done under x-ray though. his theory was that none of the other docs knew for sure if they hit the right spot because they weren viewing it under x-ray. soon i had the painful injection two weeks ago and guess what. it didn help a thing. i called the do and ism going back on wednesday...have had so many injections in the hip that i have a major crater there from fat atrophy.i know that was a long story...but has anyone experienced anything like this? its more than bursitis.....could the an be progressed to a point that bad enough to hurt that bad yet not be seen on x-ray? he mentioned that it may look like i have a liberal tear on my x-ray...what is that and is it something to be treated because he mentioned it like it was nothing. ism so frustrated.thanks for listening!

2667,ism hoping someone may have insight into this woke up 5 days ago with slight irritation on one side of my labia... like where my thing touches. i had noticed an increase in milky discharge (with no unpleasant odor) so assumed possibly i had a least infection coming on.of course i looked every 3 seconds at it and it got a little more and more uncomfortable.night two worried me the most.. i think the monistat applied typically did it. it was still only slightly red but burning (typically only). i noticed that it would feel that way when it was in contact with my discharge.. when i was sitting down and my underwear is against it (presumably soaking up the moisture) there is very little discomfort.i also have noticed the discomfort moves around depending on how i am sitting or what i am doing. sometimes its back on my anus (on the left side) and other times it is all the way up front on the left side above the clitoris area... again where the discharge touchesyesterday it was almost better until i took a super hot shower and used a lot of water on that area.. then my anus was stinging.. so i got the smart idea to use some lubriderm on it.. yeah hold moisture on a too moist area.. smart, eh?anyhow, there are no bump, no sores, no cuts, just a little bit of redness (which is on both sides actually) and then topical softness which feels like its a bit raw. it has been going on for about 5 days and is no worse (at times better)my boyfriend has never had any symptoms of anything like this before, nor have i. we haven even had scars beforehand ideas???????

2677,ism quite confused to what going on.ism always tired i go to bed early and wake up at a decent time. during the week i get my 8-12 hours of sleep, also lookout and eat healthy. i live a good lifestyle and i feel at 21 i shouldn be feeling like this especially because i dont have anything that tresses me minus the fact that ism always tired. also nothing has changed same school and job.went to 3 different regular doctors they dont know what it is had my blood drawn and everything was perfect, went to and and got expensive vitamin b pills, still didn fix the problem. due to my tiredness it makes me depressed, i cannot concentrate, i always feel very overwhelmed and get anxiety.knowing that i have something to do during the week i start packing and get very overwhelmed and fidgeted. i took a few smelters off from school because i have been getting bad grades due to feeling careless and unable to focus.have always been one who has it hard to focus in school and finishing my school task completely,i always am doing 3 things at once. this has been going on for about three in a half years now and its just getting worst. the worst part is its effecting my school because i just canst sit there and concentrate and stay focused.its also depressing that my friends are all energetic and excited to do things and i can because ism constantly thinking about sleeping.give been searching there quite a few things that stood out to me that could possibly be the problem.first i thought i was anaemic but blood tests,iron were perfect.i also was looking and saw that i had a lot of symptoms of adult add.so i took a test and it came out to 72 which scores that i most likely am and should seek professional help.one of my good friends has add and is prescribed to adderall(adderrall),i talked to him about it and he said i could possibly have it. so he gave me one of his adderalls to test and it completely helped me got everything done,felt energies, and i honestly haven felt like that for a very long time.felt like a new person,stay focused and did things throughout the day.so i decided to go to a psychiatric yesterday,very nice and really understood me,unlike other doctors he made me feel comfortable. he then prescribed me viibryd its a new prescription and it will help you focus and be not so depressed about the sleeping, ext..my other doctor prescribed me lorazepum(does nothing for me) because he thinks i have anxiety, which i somewhat do.strongly searching,i dont think i should take the viibryd (if anyone knows any into on it or experienced viibryd ism interested on hearing your experience or what you think about it) i dont think ism that depressed as much as others for this also reviews on the viibryd are bad.with the lorazepum just makes me more tired and relaxed and still not getting my responsibilities done, and my psychiatric agreed about the lorazepum that i shouldn take it. now ism ensure how i go about getting adderall(adderrall)from my psychiatric or what to say,i heard its hard to be prescribed it. i almost feel awkward to even suggest it to him because he probably thinks ism just another college student trying to get adderall(adderrall)and get high or whatever it is that college kiss do with it.i honestly am not like that i felt like a normal person when i took it,got so much done and felt like it was for me. my psychiatric did say i could have add but didn go much forward about it.just gave me the anti depressing pills which seem like a big harm to the body.i dont know if i should tell him about the overall i tried or tell him i got sick off this viibryd or ask to take actions on finding out if i do have add? i just dont want to risk not getting it.also thinking of just going to another psychiatric and say my doctor said i should take viibyrd for my slight depression and my possible add problem? so what to do?!ism only 21 and i miss out on everything because i get overwhelmed, over think,and have a temper! hope someone can help! thank you.

2680,i am a 33 year old mallein january 2010, i had protected sex with a girl, if i recall it felt like a little irritation for 2 weeks..but not enough to really raise my attention..( i realize now that on and cry take 2 weeks for symptoms(symptoms)i have read) then after 2 weeks..i had sex with a london..but protected oral with an ex.    2 days later i had awful burning and urge to private, completely unbearable and had to go to the hospital. doctor took a swab and gave me a shot..prescription for 4 azithromycin and sent me on my way. the next day i had relieve but still slight burning.the next week i seen my family doctor and told him what happened, i told him i didn have relief yet..and he prescribed me doxycycline for 2 weeks. i contracted both girls and neither claimed to have positive test results. my test result came back positive for clymedia ( if false positive agent that common? i am ensure at this point)i did not have sex with the first girl again, however i did have sex with the ex...protected and protected oral. same problem..not not as strong. ( at this point i blamed lubricated condemn? or i gave her something morally) i continued on doxyclcline and also went on flag, more azithro. tons of drugs on the course of the year and always would get this problem after having sex with her morally and even non morally eventually. i believe she insisted it was an excuse to leave her...alone. eventually i blamed her and left her alone by fall. there were 2 incidents with her..that i had very slight symptoms(symptoms). i also noticed that the more i had sex with her...the worse it got.still no relief but i see a pattern that after having sex with her..and sometimes stronger symptoms(symptoms)than others...my sinuses would flare..my mouth would be frothy in the morning and it would burn when i printed and very frequent privation that lasts and fades for up to 2 weeks. with or without antibiotics i had learned eventually, i thought doxycycline was giving me relief but maybe the frequent printing is just an illusion to relief...i am ensure of everything at this point. another consistent symptom is thick ejaculation and low sex drive until eventually after 2 weeks my ejaculation starts becoming watery again..and my sex drive goes back up.note that i have had several tests for urine tests, cry, gone, swabs...all negative...except for the first one..also took them in the early morning to prevent bad results...apex 5 tests..at various times during the year.so i eventually had sex with a different woman, a friend..someone i can trust, it was drunk and i had not had symptoms(symptoms)for 3 weeks and had taken meditations and stopped. i assuming the ex was the cause. i had no problems the first time...however...the second time with this woman i had problems again...possible coincidence? or did i pass her something?    she went to the doctor and got all tests she could....with her family doctor who she is close with....her doctor advised her she was fine and had nothing. i trust this opinion unlike the other 2 before.i never had sex with this woman again...fear of problems..i later had sex beginning of this year with a younger girl of 19, no problems, no oral sex.. london used... didn notice problems....had sex second time with no london..no oral sex....never really noticed any problems maybe a slight irritation, ensure if it was normal, i have forgotten what normal is now.note that most of these girls have had sex with one or more guns after..and i have not heard anything about problems or have i been asked or consulted about anything.i finally got an appointment to a urolgist, he immediately told me that he sees this problem all the time, that its just pretty much in my mind , apologized that he want being rude and that if it ceased my mind i could get a tube down my urethra with a camera and view for any problems...this i have not done yet, nor do i think it will solve anything. he also said it cannot be my anatomy if i masturbate and have no problems..yet have sex with the original girl that is my ex and immediately have problems. his suggestion was to stay away from her and move on.    i found this useless information i drove 4 hours for. :(i met a new girl in the last month, has sex with her once with a london, no problems it seemed...no oral sex....second time a few days ago......this is the longest i haven had problems...over 1 month almost 2......but this should be noted,,, i had drank clot of alcohol in the last 2 weekend..and drank clot of peri...i noticed a very slight burning coming back...but it did not make me private or anything of that sort. i had sex with this girl without a london...and the results were as strong as the original ex...i am now right back to where i started. 24 hour burning....in sure i have more to this story, but cannot think of it..but can answer any questions that may target the problem. i also used to private in a clear glass and watch the results every day. i noticed that my urine would have a white string substance and somewhat cloudy in its centre almost like a cloudy centralized unit with string white stuff coming from it..maybe 4 of them. as my symptoms(symptoms)depleted so would this substance ( i had sent in urine with this showing for testing, ensure of what they tested for, i think a basic test, ensure if this would show anything)i am beyond frustrated at this point....and lost.. do i have clymidia?    is it in my prostate?are the symptoms(symptoms)in getting can be something else? can i relieve symptoms(symptoms)of clymedia on my own? but never fully get rid of it?was i miss diagnosed in the beginning? or did i catch 2 different things? one still remaining?has all this caused me to develop some type of problem in which i cannot fight off different bacteria of other peoples throats or women vaginal fluids?id like to know how i can actually test what this is?thank you for your time and expertise, i am willing to follow up and continue this thread until a problem is found as i do not believe in alone in this suffering. and in certainly not making it up... the symptoms(symptoms)are extremely strong. and not stress related at all as you can clearly see.thank you for you help

2693,ism on the pill, and normally i start taking sugar pills on a wednesday and get my period that friday until sunday. i had sex on the with of june and we used a london and he pulled out. on sunday july st, i experienced some bleeding which was like a light period. that bleeding continued on monday, tuesday, and wednesday. on that wednesday i took my sugar pills and the bleeding stopped until that saturday and sunday. it was light enough to fill up a party line each day. it lasted for 5 days total, and it still looked like a light period. would you think this is implantation bleeding or a missed up period because of stress, or an increase in working out?
2694,visit this week to oncologist.    can-29 still going down, (test three weeks from last one), but decision was to discontinue gear and carboplatin, (bad reaction to the carboplatin six weeks ago after being on it for 9 months,alternating with taxotere).    because of the l-glutamine supplement working after last taxotere to control/eliminate mouth sores, doctor asked if i would go back to taxotere every three weeks instead of every six weeks with another them in between.    so, now i will start next week on an every three-week cycle of taxotere with the addition of austin. i understand that austin has recently been approved for breast cancer.    it seems as if it can have some horrible side-effects in 2% of the people, (congestive heart failure, stroke, lung hemhorrage), and as i seem to get every side-effect from every them i have been on, this is a little scar!.    any information on austin from those who may have taken it?    (i was diagnosed with stage iv nitrogen receptor positive bc with metastases to the bones in 2004, controlled by arimidex for 27 months, but then spread to lungs and liver in jan2007, so had to start them at that point.    can-29 was 9500 before starting taxotere and carboplatin, now down to 135 and i have returned to work full-time)
2695,i just had my second m/c and my doctor want me to have a sg at the hospital.    has anyone has this done?    my problem isn becoming pregnant, its staying pregnant.    my two m/c were very early 6 weeks and 8 weeks.    help! ism scared
2696,my husband suffered a haemorrhagic stroke 3 weeks ago. he has regained some use of his right side again but still canst talk much or walk. what is his chance of survival?
2697,someone brought up a good point, and one that have been wondering about since my diagnosis.    are fibrosis and cirrhosis one in the same?    some medical people imply that it is, and some imply it isn just by the mere virtue of calling it two different things.    and, if the two are not the same, then what exactly is the difference?    i have a nice color picture (astray harm) of the whole i system, (got it from he docks office) which shows what each of the healthy organs look like and what they look like as they progress towards disease.    the liver looks like this in order of severity:normal liver->bacterial keratitis->vital keratitis->fatty liver->cirrhosis->post necrotic cirrhosis.    nowhere in this diagram is there an arrow pointing to, or even a mention of, fibrosis.    unless its cirrhosis!    am i on the right track?    can you confuse me, if that possible?    :)        path (activist)
2698,hi,i just joined this group and ism trying to find some answers.    i have had severe pain in my back and legs for years, would stumble now and then and had times of my legs hurting so bad that all i could do was try to sleep.    it was all intermittent.    it became worse in 01/08 and by 03/08 i could barely walk, the pain became constant, and a new thing hit, my lower half from the hips to the toes gets actually physically colder than it should.    by 4/08 i couldn walk at all, i canst move my legs, i canst put any weight on them without falling.    i went to the er since i am uninjured and from there was referred to a neurologist.    i had multiple its with and without contrast, multiple miss with and without contrast, x-rays of my back and legs, blood work, and a nerve condition test.    the lowest temperature in my lower half    has hit 36 degrees as confirmed during the nerve condition test when they had to use a heat lamp and hot towels to get it to register.    my lower half gets too cold, after laying flat for several hours with a heating blanket then my temperature will increase to normal, my skin will feel clammy once it arms up.    i am always too tired, always in too much pain that goes from my neck to my toes, and i have lost all muscle strength in my legs and am losing strength in my hands and arms.    the neurologist said i have degenerative spinal bone disease because the tests show bone spurs all over my spine, i have two discs in my neck that are bulging, one disc in my lower lumbar that is compressed but none of those are pitching the nerves, i have damaged the autonomy nerve in my leg because the test shows that the area where the nerve should be is black and doesn receive or send signal, i have a tumor on my kidney, a tumor on my right ovary, and a lesion on my liver.    the official diagnosis was degenerative spinal bone disease and degenerative autonomy nerve damage causing complex regional pain syndrome.    i dont know what to think or what to do.    i am so tired of being in constant pain and not being able to walk or move my legs and now with my hands and arms being affected i am afraid of what may happen next.    the pain increases and my lower half starts increasing in temperature the longer i sit up.    the neurologist said that she ruled out ms because i dont meet all of the criterion and she didn see any lesions on my spine, just bone spurs and discs out.any ideas would be appreciated.
2699,quite a few weeks ago my lower eyelid was puffy and sore, feeling a bit like it was bruised.    now it feels fine, except a bit of itching now and then and my eyelashes near the area are turned toward my eye probably because of the slight bulge where the infection is.    there is a ball type feel to it on the outside and the inside of the eyelid has a light shape to it, like a healing sore.    recently i had an eye doctor visit and was told it was a state infection.    i was instructed to apply a hot compress and massage it, putting a drop of vigamox two times a day for 7 days.    it has not seemed to change other than less dryness at night and throughout the day.    any suggestions?
2700,i am in week 11 incevik and and und at week 4, at week 8 still und but everything was low bc 1.7 rec 2.82 hug 9.6 they where talking adjusting beds, i told them no just check it again i have been feeling a bit better and think i have come up. she said she did not think so, but having treated me with inter/peg for 84 weeks before and knowing me she would check. well yesterday she called and said to continue on as i have been that my levels had risen up a little bc 1.9 rec 2.95 hug 10.0 no great jump but going up.i think this is a very good sign ? what you think ?
2701,my boyfriend and i had sex and he hit something that kind of hurt, moved a little bit and was fine. i never experienced any discomfort but then a day later i went to the bathroom and on the to was light pink sporting. i chalked it up to being my period so i got a pad. the next morning, there was nothing but i figured i would start later in the day so i continued with the pad. when i went to work i had gone to the bathroom and checked the pad to find a very light calomel colored    goes spot on the pad. i was very confused because i have never seen anything like that. i wiped it off and have not seen it since. later that evening had notice that i had begun to have more discharge- a reddish/brown color. not really bleeding and no sort of lining discharge. typically i get bloated, have lower back pain and my breasts get very tender before my period- this time nothing. i am due for my period so i would have assumed this is it but its so different from any others. my boyfriend and i are not using any type of contraceptive, we have been intimate for the last 6 months w/ no changes in my period. i dont know if its because he could have hit my croix a certain way, if i could be pregnant or if i should worry about have some other problem. there has been no change in diet or stress until now.
2702,i read somewhere that you can have hearing loss from ms. i have a ringing most of the time....but this has happened to me:recently, my left ear went very muffled, full feeling...then went to hearing nothing out of the left ear at all for a few minutes...then back to the full, muffled feeling.then the next day, the left ear continued to feel full, and hearing is muffled....but then everytime i talked, or someone else talks, i was hearing a very amplified high pitch echo in my left ear. like a roaring, whistling, echo....this has happened several different times lasting a day or less each time.no cold or sickness at all. i had my hearing tested, is was within normal limits, i also saw and went, who didn see anything wrong with my ears.currently, i am back to my okay hearing, with just the constant humming and ringing.does this sound ms related to you?thanks
2703,about 2 months ago i had a really bad rash on my inner thighs that made it hard to even walk around. i went to my dermatologist and he prescribed ketaconazole cream and another cortizone cream telling me it was a fungus. at first this was only on my thighs and not on my scrotum or penis. those dreams didn really do much the first week but they did seem to irritate my scrotum. two weeks later my thighs looked about the same and now my scrotum was very swollen, very itchy, and red. i went to a different dermatologist and he gave me protopic cream and a rescript for antibiotics (he also said to continue using the ketaconazole as well). the first night i applied the protopic to my scrotum the only thing i can say is it was the worst discomfort i have ever felt in my life... my scrotum was on fire! ice was the only thing that would help it. i lost a few nights sleep because of it. i didn continue using the protopic but did continue using the ketaconazole for about 2 weeks and everything finally got really dry and my skin on my thighs and on my scrotum (and a little on my penis as well) started to lake off. then everything got back to normal and that the way it stayed for about two months. now about 2 weeks ago i ate a few ranges (never had them before) and had a reaction on my face. i had a rash around my eyes and my upper lip got blisters on it. i went to the term. and he prescribed a dose of prednisone. i took it for about 4 days and i was back to normal with my eyes still being a little itchy but the rash seems to be gone. now two days after i stopped taking the prednisone my scrotum all of a sudden is all red, swollen, and itchy! the undermine of my penis is inflamed as well. nothing on my thighs at all. i lost another night of sleep last night because of the intense itchiness and now i dont know what to do. is this a reaction to the prednisone? or the ranges? the dr. gave me a act supply of the prednisone but he told me to only take it for a few days... should i finish the prescription? thanks for any help.
2704,i am a 24 year old woman, and am facing problems with some kind of vaginal infection. this has been going on for over 1 year and 3 months i am literally on the edge.i have seen numerous doctors who have each prescribed me with numerous antibiotics such as flag etc.. including beds for me and my partner to take. at first the doctors did tests and actually found a least infection however as time past i was dealing with the same complaints and no sign of any type of infection on the test results.on average i would have white see through discharge mixed in with some kind of bloody discharge or just brown discharge, it varies.most times while having intercourse i have difficulties getting moist, and feels like something is rubbing me from the inside ( extremely painful) and a burning sensation afterwards at times my vagina even swells up about twice its size!i have heard that after long periods of infection people can get a type of vaginism so ism trying out a sexologist and this has helped me as well but the pain often remains.however my no said that its only due to irritation but i am more worried.i feel i should mention , i had an abortion about 2 years ago (no judgment please) and am very scared that maybe something else had gone wrong during this process because i was wide awake and i actually was in extreme pain during the whole ordeal.i also had a very severe infection which was due to the abortion i took some antibiotics for that but afterwards everything was back to normal.i also often have pains in my lower abdomen.please somebody help!i am in desperate need feel like doctors dont care and have given up

2720,ism 21 years old and i have a slightly large goitre on my neck. i have had it for maybe 4 years, but never paid much attention to it until i started noticing it got somewhat larger, and there was an occasional sharp/stabbing pain. i went to my doctor, she ran blood tests, and she told me that i had hyperthyroidism, so i went home and searched on the internet all the symptoms, and it seems as though i have the opposite. but when i really analyze it the symptoms are basically split in half. i know with most conditions symptoms vary from person to person, but i just find that strange. is there any possible chance my doctor was wrong and its actually hypothyroidism? how do i go about asking her about that? i dont want to seem like a know-it-all patient, trying to self-diagnose myself with research off the internet. ism going back next week to discuss my ultrasound results and get started on treatment.also, ism a little worried about having thyreoid cancer. i know its rare, but there is a pain in my neck right where the goitre is. its not a constant pain, there is just an abrupt sharp/stabbing pain which occurs a couple times a day perhaps. i feel as though all this waiting is driving me insane and i dont want to wait until next week.if anyone has any advice or answers ind appreciate it. thanks.

2723,i have seen several posts on tollers being pick eaters and i know the typical response from experts is that as long as the toller is otherwise healthy there is nothing to worry about.but our three year old has never shown an interest in eating anything (except for potato chips or your, which she does not mind) ever.    in fact she does not even eat chocolate or cake.    take a piece of chocolate or cake to her mouth and she will run.    she has to practically be force-fed every day.    even feeding her a cup of milk is torture for both involved.    we long for the day when she will be able to eat on her own and are worried she will never adjust to day care.    currently her mon takes care of her at home.    she is developmental normal and loves playing, being read to, etc., and is otherwise a happy toller.    height and weight are within the normal range as well.is this at all normal and will she ever eat like normal children?    any tips on how to make her want to eat?any help appreciated.

2731,all right, folks-- could those of you who have actually experienced lime disease tell me if my teenage daughter sounds like a likely candidate?    her elias was negative (but so was every other test they've run on her!) and dry agent interested in following up with a western blot.    ism trying to decide whether or not to push.first, i should say that she never had a tick bit that we know of, although she was definitely in some tick-y areas first week of may.    also, she spent two weeks in rural china at end of march, so no telling what she might have gotten into there.symptoms:    at end of may, she woke up with a wobbly ankle... it just rolls outward when she walks.    she can stand on toes, but not on heel.    during testing, dry discovered some numb areas on leg and opposite arm.    her leg went completely numb for about a week this summer, then went back to just wobbly after she fell and her back seemed to pop.    (no, she has no back problems,according to numerous mrs and it scars).    she has extreme fatigue and back pain.    no headache, fever or other vital type symptoms.have discovered i can pull anything from any description on internet and make it fit her... so ism asking those of you whole really been there.     does this sound at all like lime--or another tick disease--to you?thanks!dazedmom

2736,not sure if topic area is correct. anyway, several months ago my wife discovered she had a cyst on one of her varies (she was in for a bad bladder infection). the do said it didn look like anything to worry about. she now has insurance and plans to get it checked out anyway. she has complained on and off lately about a slight pain or discomfort in her abdomen that comes and goes. her periods seem to be on track except for every time she thinks sheds done and we have sex, she bleeds some more for another day then sheds done (she says i always find her secret pocket and knock it loose). =p she began her period around the with and over the last few days we have had clot of maggie style sex along with her complaining of the same abdominal discomfort. the discomfort went away a couple of days ago, but last night during sex while she was climbing, i looked down and noticed blood beginning to appear on my penis. it seemed to be quite a bit- more than when i find her secret pocket. she has been off the pill for a couple of months (were trying to get pregnant). could this be because of the cyst or could it be implantation bleeding? from what have read its probably not implantation, but it would be nice to know that it was instead of something detrimental! anyone have a clue? -thanks
2737,i am about at my wits end.    for three years now i have had chronic lower abdominal pain.    i have been to so many days and eyes....still no answers.    this started in 08 after i had my son, and also had forgeries for cervical cancer and to remove my full bladder.    no one has been able to tell me anything.    at first they would come on once every few months....now i am having them weekly...and i am also having blood in my urine.    there is no warning signs to my pain...it just hits me out of    no where.    it is in my low abdominal, right above my pelvic line.    it radiates sometimes into my back....and hurts all over in the lower abdominal, but sometimes is isolated to the right side from time to time.    when it hits,. it hits hard and i canst even stand up straight.    i get sick to my stomach and it feels like someone is lipping my inside out.    i have had dry laugh at me, i have had them tell it is was all in my head.    at this point, i am so ready to give up and just accept the fact that i will never have an answer or be better.    the pain beds they give me really do nothing for the pain, only make me want to sleep.    i do get a slight relief if i lay on the bed perfectly still and do not move.    the pain is still there, but lessons a had, of course until i move again.    the full blown pain can last any where from as short as 3 hours to a full 24.    but then once the massive pain is over i am tender and soar for days to follow.    i am so needing answers....if anyone can relate, please advise!    thanks for your time.

2743,hello all, i have had quite a few raised white large lumps on my cheek and mouth that are painless, and raised. i used dip tobacco for about two years and recently quit.i also have ear pain that comes and goes jaw pain that comes and goes, and a large swollen gland under my neck that pushes up on my tonsil causing a sore throat/feeling like a hair is caught back there.i have an apt for my up tomorrow. as i have been to urgent care centers, and they have all said that the lumps dont look cancerous, and every time they just test me for step, which always comes back negative, as well as my dentist. although he did say that some of them could be caused by my improved brushing habits.what i was wondering, is could a lot of this be caused by my chronic infections that i get, like ear infections and tonsillitis. as i have very narrow ear canals. about the only thing that scars me is that lump under my tonsil that is pushing up on it.
2744,what kinds of things can give a false new for copious? i take diuretics and a host of other prescription beds. i have a pituitary adenoma which i take brocritine to shrink. could either of these be causing the problem?
2745,i am going in for brain surgery soon. one of the things that devastated me is the thought of being away from my little ones (1 1/2 and 3 1/2) for so long. with no complications, i will be in the hospital for 3-5 days. i suspect i will not want them to visit me there, as i will look pretty bad. of course, ill still look gross when i get home, but we will deal with that when that time comes. i got mummy/daughter portraits done to remind them of what i will look like again once i am healed.i have only been away from them for 1 night. i need the creative mammas here to help me come up with ideas to help me and them!so far, i have bought them a small present for every day i am gone. it is something that can help entertain them for that day (paint sets, dress up, toys, etc.)i used my webcam to record our nightly prayers together. i am also using my webcam to record me reading stories with them. i will leave the video for their caregivers to watch with them if they get upset or sad. if they are getting through fine, then there no need to remind them ism not there.any other thoughts or ideas? i know someone who used a paper chain with links to be removed for each day the parent was gone, but i dont know how long i will be gone.i know people leave their kiss all the time. i just haven and this is not the best way to start. there are different people coming and going to watch them, and of course everyone i trust to care for my kiss is also stressed out about my surgery. i know they will be fine, and ism probably just transferring my anxieties to this because its easier to worry about this than think about all the risks of surgery. but i have to plan, i have to do something!!
2746,approximately 2 years ago i had a liking accident and did never damage to my elbow.    i snapped the head of the radius completely off and dislocated the humerus.    in the process i also managed to are the entire lateral ligament complex of the elbow.    my surgeon managed to delicate the humerus and attach the head of the radius with a plate and some screws.    he also managed to attach the torn ligaments.    after many months of physical therapy i now have almost all of my range of motion back.    since the pain of the surgery has gone away i started to notice that i have been having ulnar nerve problems.    every time i rest my arm on something, like an arm rest, my pink finger and ring finger fall asleep really quickly.    i was wondering if this has happened to anyone else out there. or if someone could point me in the right direction with possible problems or treatment.     thanks in advance.

2751,i am 26 years old. almost 2 weeks ago i developed a sore throat, swollen tonsils (but no pus or pockets or fever) and slightly swollen lymph nodes under my jaw. i went to the clinic, took a step test and it was negative. i was told it was either from the post nasal drip from my galleries or vital. she told me that if my sore throat didn get any better by the th day from the first day of symptoms to take z-pay that she prescribed. the next day i woke up with all of the symptoms of a cold, funny nose, sneering, cough but still no fever or pus pockets in my throat. that lasted for about 5 days.    by that time the cold was almost gone and the sore throat was gone but my tonsils were still swollen. i finished the 5 day z-pay yesterday (which would be the with day since symptoms appeared) but my tonsils are still swollen and red. my throat no longer hurts and the lymph nodes under my jaw are almost back to normal. there are no pus pockets or yellow stuff on my tonsils. they are just red and swollen and a little painful. i have galleries and take claranix-d daily. can swollen tonsils be due to galleries? the only times i have ever had swollen tonsils is when i had step years ago. if it was bacterial shouldn it be almost gone by now from the beds?
2752,my girlfriend and i sometimes have outside partners, so we get tested for its regularly in addition to using condemn.    so far our test results have been negative over three test cycle (once every six months).    this is great, except that something is starting to bother me.we both have had cold sores (ak oral he-1) in the past.    i dont think either of us has had an outbreak in the last year, but we both clearly remember the white bump around the mouth that pitched and went away after a few days (and was improved by over the counter herpes crimes).so how can we test negative using herpeselect elias ogg multiple times?    one false negative i could understand, but three (or six if you count both of us).    can i trust any of the test results?!    shouldn we have have antibodies if we know we have had cold sores?    is there another he that also causes oral cold sores?we used told for the order and results.    the blood was drawn at two different local laws (owned by different companies).any ideas?

2755,my husband has struggled with anxiety his whole life. its always been in the back of his head, but recently hers hit rock bottom. hers been seeing a counselor for the last 2 months - and i think its brought his anxiety to the forefront since he is rousing so much on it now. in the last 10 days, he has gone over the edge and hers realized that he needs to do more, so we went and saw his doctor who prescribed him canal and aloft. the issue is - hers not a pill copper. the man wont even take a tylenol for his worst headache. hers struggling to the point where he is now also depressed and thinks hers going to lose everything in the world. he has taken a few canal, but he waits until his anxiety is through the roof before he takes it, then it doesn work too well. he doesn want to start taking the aloft until this weekend when he is off from work because hers scared of what it could do to him.i guess the point of my writing this is - what can i do?? i feel so helpless and sad for him. hers never been like this and it will get better - i know it will, but hers just so desperate and summed and i feel like there is nothing i can do. ism suppurative, i hold his hand, i tell him things will be okay, and i encourage him to take his beds. living with him is like walking on egg shells because i canst do anything right... and i know its not me, i know its his frustration that talking. i get that. its just the hardest thing to have to watch the person you love struggle so bad. so ism asking you spouse that love someone with severe anxiety/depression and those of you who possibly have anxiety - what else can i do? this is the hardest thing ever. this is just the beginning and i know still get better, but to him his world is crashing down and hers hopeless. its so sad. any suggestions?

2758,actually, i have had a herpes simple about 6 month ago that cured 2 month later but red marks are still visible on my lips.in addition, i have been using anti-sinuses for more than 3 month such as val acyclovir and i am definitely sure that the cycle is done since it has been 6 months.therefore, what is your opinion as an expert and what would you recommend me to do? moreover, for further information it seems to me that these red marks respond to the heat and to the sun by growing and extending in size.as an expert, do you think that kissing someone at this point might me harmful? will i be transferring the virus to that person?thank you in advance

2764,ism a 37-year old male in excellent physical condition, swam in college and have been competing in triathlons for 15 years.    exactly 1 month ago i went for a 2-hour 35 mile bicycle ride in the blazing florida summer heat (i know, not the smartest move)    though have trained in the heat before and brought fluids with me on the ride, the 100+ heat index took its toll.    i ended up with extremely severe heat exhaustion toward the end of the ride, i probably should have went to the er following my return home.upon waking the next day i had a severe, crushing headache with pressure.    four weeks after this incident i have sensations of vestige when moving my head side to side, up or down, or bounding my head such as when i run.....its as if my eyes canst follow along with my head.    standing up after have been sitting also creates this vestige effect.    the vestige also creates an unsteadiness to my balance. have also noticed a feeling of pressure in the upper, inside corners of both my eyes and discomfort moving my eyes from side to side.    this vestige has all but put a hold on my exercise as any head movement trigger the sensation.also of note, i assume as a side effect of the extreme heat exhaustion, i appear to have become heat intolerant.    any exposure to stagnant heat, even without exercise, and my heart rate shoots the roof along with associated dizziness.    during these episodes i just canst get my heart rate to come down and must quickly get into an air conditioned building.    almost called 911 as one time i nearly fainted.being have never felt any of these symptoms before i fear the severe heat exhaustion/exertion has caused all this.    i went to a neurologist 3 weeks ago for a physical exam and mr of the brain and all came back ok.    neurologist just told me to rest.    my up did blood work and all came back normal, blood pressure was normal, he recommended i see an went specialist.could this be something vascular that occurred in the brain that want picked up on the mr?    could severe dehydration & heat exhaustion trigger these symptoms?    could the vestige be due to a sinus infection or inner ear issue?    ism concerned as have never experienced vestige like this before and never had a month-long headache before.    thanks for any advice!

2766,my maternal grandfather has always had problems sleeping, and my mother has inherited this to some degree, not helped by the fact that she works shifts. i first noticed i had trouble sleeping at age 11, roughly 6 years ago. i know it runs in the family, but mine is so much more severe than my sum and grandpa's. it has gotten to the stage now where i go several days without any sleep and then a couple of days where i sleep, but it is broken and filled with nightmare. my mental health is not great, but not as bad as it has previously been (where the only sleep i could ever get was drug-induced).i have just finished high school, where the problem was bad but manageable. i am due to start a job on thursday and it includes administering meditations (to dogs and cats, but that not the point), and i canst afford to be overturned and running on adrenalin.any suggestions or general feedback would be much appreciated.thanks

2769,hey guns sorry i have been out of the loop. my daughter was in the hospital again( whole other story) but i have a question. is it just me, or does this whole tiger woods thing stir up feelings in any of you who have been in his wife situation? i have been doing so well. or at least trying to. my husband said he is trying to forget the past and it drives him nuts when i bring it up so i just bite the bullet but this thing is really eating at me.in our last session the therapist pulled out a pencil, he asked me what was on the top of it. of course i answered an fraser. he asked why. i said to ease mistakes. he said who ever invented it knew that there was a need for it. that mistakes would be made. you can cross them out but still have a mark that they are there or you can ease it and it is gone. so i realized he was telling me let it go. could have been worse so on sunday i went out and purchased two decorative erases, that night gave one to my husband and one for myself. i was surprised when he feared up. i made a promise that i would no longer dwell on this situation but said if he ever did anything remote like this again i was gone. but you can not turn on to, radio or look at a paper without the whole tiger woods thing coming up. it has trigger so much emotion and distrust in me again. yesterday my husbands supervisor called our house by accident meant to call his cell #. i was at work but my daughter took the call. she creaked out on the woman b/c she saw that it was her days work #. knows this woman works there too, so when the sup. asked for joe, kate said why are you calling him. dont ever call him again. the supervisor was so apologetic. said who she was and had a blood moment and called the wrong #. my daughter felt so bad she called me crying. i realize this has effected her to. i think she seems me as weak because i am choosing to let it go.
2770,hi,    ism new here and i had made another post in a different section that went unanswered i hope it doesn happen to this one.i have been dealing with pain in my joints and severe headache and inguinal hernia due to a rare connective tissue disorder (hers-dances) i have some vascular involvement and extreme hyper-mobility in my joints and have dislocations all the time in most of my joints (elbows, shoulders, ankles, especially my hips because when they rest they slam down on a nerve or something and i can feel it shoot down my leg like a breaking lightning bolt ) of my joints.    i was just given a referral to a pain management doctor after this diagnosis was made and all the tests were run.in the meantime i have been put on 5/325 nor which do a decent job of getting rid of the pain, and anyone that has had chronic pain for a very long time knows that even decent reduction in pain is like a godson.    however, i was told by my geneticist that the first step was going to be to find the right combination of meditation to completely kill the pain, not just reduce it but 100% kill the pain, with this news came a mixed feeling of joy and apprehension.what i am worried about is, the last thing in the world i want is to be stuck on necrotic pain meditation for the rest of my life ( ism only 22! ), but given the choice between necrotic pain meditation and the pain have been in since i was 8, ill take my chances with the meditation.    i would like to know if anyone has ever been told similar news first step is to find the right combination of meditation to kill the pain completely, and what was done, and again if god forbid i am stuck on this meditation, how i fight becoming addicted.    anything else that may be helpful to me would also be great..i would very much appreciate input of any kind as i am very very new to doctors and this whole... process and am somewhat scared about certain aspects of all this.thank you very much.

2775,i just have one sex partner: my wife. however, 4 days ago in a very stupid act i went to a strippers club and ended up having intercourse with one of the girls. i used a london but i am still very worried and this is the reason:i could not properly do it, did not have a proper erection and was really drunk. she put the rubber on me and i did not check if it was properly done. not that i could tell, since i had only had my wife as sex partner until then and had never used a london in my life. since i want having an erection i tried to masturbate with the london on after i had tried to penetrate her (thus i touched the used outside of the london), and after getting a better erection i tried to do it again. plus i was really drunk and dont know for sure how much contact i had with her fluids. next day, about 7 hours after the contact i masturbated (was still drunk and not thinking clear yet).besides the obvious guilt and regret i am very worried about being infected. i already know that i could have infected myself by the masturbation. how high is the probability of this being so? what about the probability of getting his in this way?    any thoughts? what should i do?i do feel some discomfort in my groin, and have been having to see very often my penis looks ok and i dont have any obvious signs of a disease (no weird secretions or red areas etc). any help would be greatly appreciated. please help!nicholas

2782,i am very frustrated concerning my 38 year old daughter. she has moral valve relapse with regurgitation. they have been watching it for some time now doing echoes and tears. the cardiologist    says that it is getting worse now , it has become severe and she started to look for option for surgery. her insurance wont let her go outside nays so she can go to cleveland clinic where her dr. wanted her to go. the hospital that was chosen was strong memorial in rochester ny. well she had the consult and actually set up surgery thinking that both leaflets in the valves are shot and that they would be repaired. the surgeon reviewed the previous tests and he did an echo and he is not in agreement with my daughters cardiologist he feels that it is moderate and not severe. he told us that you never do heart surgery to early because of the risks and you have to watch to make sure you dont do it late either. they wanted her to do a stress echo which she just did. that was what his findings were that he feels it is just moderate and not time to do the surgery.when she had the stress echo done the dr. told her that when she started she had all these extra beats that were all over the place and she should have that looked into. i need to give you some past on my daughter. she went into cardiac arrest 4 years ago. they feel it seemed like because her potassium was low. it was a miracle that she pulled out of it. it happened when she was driving her four small children. they implanted a defibrillator and nothing has happened since. the cardiologist looked at her stress echo and had another dr look at her results and he said that with her past history, he feels she may have brigade syndrome and wants her to look into this. we have gone from one bad thing to another. what i am searching for is what tests are done to find out if you have this? are they accurate tests or dangerous? has anyone ever had heart surgery with this disorder and have had positive results from it. any help would be greatly appreciated please.

2792,ism posting this separately from a below thread.    my fear is that a link may cause a thread to be delete (as have seen in some threads).    i dont want that to happen.there should be increasing information and evaluation about this news in the coming days and weeks.    it suggests that the drug works, works well, and that talks for phase 3 looks promising.    to the management; my apologies if posting this breaks rules.-willyhttp://www.renters.com/article/marketsnews/idukn2520323020070725?rec=update 1-vertex shares leap on keratitis c drug damaged july 25, 2007 12:pm entry bill berkrotnew york, july 25 (renters) - the shares of biotechnology company vertex pharmaceuticals in (vote.o: quote, profile, research) rose 10 percent on wednesday as additional information about its closely watched experimental keratitis c drug reassured investors about its chances of success.vertex, after the market closed on tuesday, provided interim data from an analysis of a clinical trial that showed fewer than 10 percent of patients who had undetectable levels of the virus after completing 24 weeks of therapy had relapsed by the end of 12 weeks of post-treatment follow-up.we view this as very impressive data and a significant de-risking event, as post-treatment relapse rate was previously the biggest unknown, peering swan analyst howard long said in a report.stanford bernstein analyst geoffrey forges noted the less than 10 percent relapse rate seen with the drug, telaprevir, or ve-950, compares with roughly 30 percent seen in standard of care studies.this difference is the basis for the likely clinical trial superiority of telaprevir, forges said in a research note.forges, who is encouraging clients to buy vertex shares, expects that telaprevir will indeed be a major breakthrough in the treatment of keratitis c virus.while the company did not diverge the sustained virologic response (sir) -- the percentage of patients in whom the virus remained below detestable levels -- in the latest data release, analysis said the data suggest the sir rate could be roughly 65 percent to 75 percent.an sir rate higher than 50 percent is considered to be very positive and 75 percent would be viewed as a home run, analysis said. the additional data also continue to suggest that adding telaprevir to standard therapy of regulated interfere and ribavirin would substantially cut down and possibly have the required length of therapy from the current 12 months.more data is expected to be veiled in november and analysis said vertex remained on track to begin late-stage clinical trials of the drug by the end of the year.but needham analyst mark monroe remained cautious about overlay optimistic timelines and said he does not expect vertex to submit an application seeking approval with u.s. regulatory until mid-2010.monroe said data to be presented in the second half of the year, will not add substantially to what is already known about (telaprevir) and consequently do not foresee a meaningful upside opportunity in the stock this fall.at its current price, we believe the stock fully reflect telaprevir's potential, added monroe, who maintained a hold rating on vertex stock.the cambridge, massachusetts, company shares were up $3.02, or 10.2 percent, at $32.74 in nasal trading at midday.

2798,my 5 year old son just started kindergarten 2 weeks ago. i have had a problem with him wetting his parts for awhile now. it comes and goes sometimes he west everyday and sometimes he will not wet for weeks. when he west it is not like he completely wet his parts it is like he leaned and just the front is wet. this does not bug him at all. he claims that he does not even feel that he is a bit wet. i have taken him to the doctor and had him tested for everything. his doctor put him on ditropan. i did not use it because he stopped wetting his parts. now he is wetting at school everyday. i do not know what to do. the school wants him in pull up and he refuses to go to school if i put one on him. the doctor said to give him the medicine but i dont think that he needs it because this just comes and goes. i have tried everything from not saying anything to him about wetting to taking things away, offering rewards, doing sticks. what do i do!!!!
2799,sorry that my story is a bit long. ill try to leave out some details even though i think they could be helpful.ism lucky if i can produce 10 minutes of useful work in a day. the task that i need to complete is to finish up the development of software that have worked on for years. most days now i get as far as opening it up and looking at it, then i just stop. i wouldn say that my mind is blank, but ism more like a deer in the headlights. i know what i have to do but i just canst start it. this has gotten worst over the past 3 to 7 years or so. ism probably within 40 hours of programming to complete many years of work but i canst do it. the software has been committed to be delivered by the end of the month to customers whom have already paid for it.as background: ism in my early was with two young kiss at home and my wife does our sales so we work together. i lost a valuable business after 9/11 along with our house, cars, boats, etc. have been a very driven person but i can no longer see past the next hour anymore. we are almost broke now with just enough money to pay what required to release the software or for a major home or auto expense, whichever comes first. my growing inability to function like this started or began to show itself mostly over the past 3 to 7 years.i get my care from the va which seems adequate. i had a pacemaker plant about 6 years ago and that may be about when things slowly started getting worst. (i knew i would end up with a pacemaker for years in advance.) about the same time as the plant, i simply stopped sleeping. i get tired but dont sleep. after many years, have found a balance of alprazalam and moving to different locations at night that now get me enough sleep. i also take gabapentin for nerve pain which seems to have improved some long standing i-polar problems. have also recently started on methylphenidate which has helped my memory. have also been diagnosed with cerebral atrophy but because of the pacemaker, i canst get an mr and the va doesn give more information than 'you've got it.working with the va can be slow and its difficult to work with the psychiatric. i pretty much have to tell her i want by and convince her to let me try something. i did take a battery of psychology exam a few years ago and appear to have passed with flying colors.i think my problems are a combination of clinical and social but i need to try to find a way to get over this hump to start making an income or my family will be homeless.any actionable suggestions are greatly appreciated.

2808,i am a 27 year old female. smoker (though trying to quit), but normalize health wise. for about 3 months now i have noticed a pain, right in the soft spot at the top of the jaw, directly behind my ear love. when it started it was infrequent and lasted only a few minutes and was only mildly annoying. now it happens every day, pretty much all day, though it is worse at night. it is a pulling/staying pain. when its happening i press hard on the area and try to massage it out but it doesn help. it pulses painfully for a few minutes, then stops, then starts again a few minutes later. about 3 weeks ago i developed a sore throat (which has not gone away), extreme fatigue and nasal congestion. that took me down for a solid week, but the fatigue and nasal congestion have gone away, leaving only the sore throat (which is worst at night and upon waking). in the last few days my jaw has become stiff and is painful when i open wide. the sore throat is on the opposite side of the jaw pain. i am going to go to the urgent care on monday, but i am hoping someone can shed some light on what all of this might mean. help?
2809,i have slight raised swelling around the opening of my penis that seems to flare up after oral and vaginal sex.    i have recently been treated for epididymitis with levaquin and had been on doxycycline for acne for two months prior to this.    i do not have any discharge and i have not had any frequent privation problems either.    there is occasional itching at the opening that comes and goes.    does this sound like chlamydia or on?    is there any other cause for this?
2810,have been but charming for 5 months now. from that, i have been able to determine that i have a short gluteal phase. (never more than 10/11 days) during my up, my temps also start dropping by about do/6. this cycle, i started taking a by-12 vitamin. i lobulated on cd22, and also started using a etc progesterone cream 1/8 top/x daily. within a couple of days, my breasts and nipples became very sore and tender. i also started feeling extremely tired, and was printing frequently. i had frequent headache and at times felt dizzy. my temps rose and i am now at dpo11. my temps have remained elevated and above my covering, though they started to go down slightly today. i did a pregnancy test today, because today would have been the day my period would have come, and it came back negative. also, my breasts are not as tender today. is this normal using a progesterone cream? can it mimi symptoms of pregnancy? was today too early to test for pregnancy? at the dosage that i am taking of the progesterone cream, will my period come on its own, or should i stop taking the cream by a certain time period?
2811,i am 26.    5'11 and 196 les.    i work out 3 days a week.    i attend a spin class for one hour per day three days per week.    i have been doing this for more than a month now.    i have lost nothing.    i am constantly tired despite getting 7 hours of sleep each night. i am getting frustrated.    any suggestions?
2812,i have been wearing contact for a few years now, and the other day i noticed my eye was kind of red (saturday). i figured it would go away after i took my contact out and put in a few eye drops.    but it is now tuesday (3 days later) and it is still kind of red, and with a closer look i noticed that there is a very small whitish dot on the edge of my iris.    my eye feels pretty normal, should i be worried?    do you think it will heal/go away on its own if i wear my glasses instead?
2813,at this mornings ultrasound they said there were 3 follicles around 12 and they would probably trigger monday morning and then timed intercourse following!    they said everything looked great..the only slight concern was my nitrogen level was elevating a bit quicker then the follicles...they said they like to see around 16 for a trigger..how does this sound? does it make sense? is 3 follicles good at this point??
2814,good evening doctor,i recently got tested for all types of steps as my boyfriend and i would like to start planning for children in the near future (2 yes). i was tested for everything on my visit, including have/2 and his/aids. i came back negative for everything except have? i spent nearly 1/2 hour with my doctor asking how? i have never had any type of outbreak (lesion/genitalwart) or common symptoms(symptoms)of this st? she mentioned my results were so low , that it could be a false positive?i am so anxious and concerned with future planning for a baby; is it a good idea for me to send away for the western blot test? i have seen so many images and articles of those who have this who have to deliver by c-section due to outbreaks.    granted, my boyfriend has had have since a child and i am wondering if this could have led to my positive results for have?this discussion is related congenital herpes... could i have it?.
2815,so i was on the deposit shot for almost 2+ years and naturally my period stopped. i have been off deposit now for almost 1 year now and my period still has not come back. i get cramps like ism going to but i never do. my question is is it still possible for me to get pregnant at this time? or am i just broken :( i really need to put my mind at see
2816,every since i had my son 18 months ago, i have developed this urge to constantly rub my teeth. i do it to hear that squeaky noise and ism at peace when i do it, like nothing else matters, as long as i can rub my teeth and hear the noise ism ok. my husband thinks its really annoying and he often gets upset when i do it, he thinks ism ruining my teeth, but i canst stop. have tried but it seems impossible... is there something wrong with me? could i possibly have old?
2817,i came here looking for answers regarding the ran scan i just had done and ism leaving with only more questions. i went to the health pages, and it appears that the procedure there follows what i had done 7 years ago. according to my doctor, this is no longer the procedure. i was given hydrogen shots so that i would not have to go without my meditation. i continued my normal, daily routine. i didn have to go on a low iodine diet, either. i was searching because i found conflicting stories on whether you could eat beforehand or not, since i was not told that i couldn; i was concerned that this could effect the outcome. has anyone else had an ran scan done, recently?
2818,my son is getting very frustrated that he is unable to run even at a slow pace without going into trial fig. dr. prescribed federal pen for a-fig without conversion on its own. sometimes my son takes it because his he is 150 for minutes after a run and the federal does convert him. it has been on year, he has taken federal only 5 times. but he is wondering if their is something else to do or just stop running completely.
2819,my dr didn say anything about an eye exam, but i figured since i was having problems i should get one.    i went in today and told them i needed a vaseline eye exam cause i was donna be thing soon.    after we were all done she told me to come back in a month(after starting to) and get a vaseline.    ism very confused!!    i thought that what we were doing today!?!?    she also didn bother fitting me for new glasses even though i told her the ones i have dont fit right.    so, does the vaseline need to be done before or after starting to?    if after, then how long should i be on it before i get my eyes checked?    has anyone else been asked to come back for it?    she also told me to call if i had flashes, flowers, or marketing in my vision.    those are the exact things i told her i was already having????

2822,just before 3 weeks i had terrible sharp pain below chest    which was later followed by nausea and then feeling of lump in the throat    (swallowing trouble) and then panic jerks while sleeping. suddenly my eyes are also staying dry and cannot read properly. my mornings use to start worse and at    nights i ended up better. dr. prescribed me with medium 40mg per day along with some tests (glucose/ll/trigycerid were little abnormal). before 3 days i did slow logging for a mile and shocking ever since then my throat problem has excavated along with severe nausea which now stays even at nights. i feel weak and sleepy but when i try to sleep it gives terrible panic jerks and wakes me up. on my and visit dr. usually checked my throat viewing inside the mouth and inspected by pressing the throat from outside and increased medium to twice a day and prescribed thyreoid test whose results yet to come.(i had the same situation before 10 years, i had done tipsy/radium/endoscopy all came to be negative with just minor stomach inflammation(inflammation). i was depressed and    lost about 30 pounds. for 1 year they treated me with antacids, depression pills, consolation    for panic attacks with not much help until i moved to a different city and surprisingly all the symptoms disappeared completely.)not sure if i have herd or something else (sometimes i do feel stomach burning now), i feel terrible, depressed and cannot effort to stay like this too long again. i need to know if anyone has gone through this situation before and is there any cure or answer for this ?
2823,i am a 42 year old female. following aggressive treatment and 6 week coma due to a burst brain aneurysm in 2007, i developed a secondary sclerosis cholangitis. gammagt rose to 2800, at which point, an each was undertaken to clear the scar tissue in the bile ducts. over the next 18 months, gammagt went down to around 60. however in the past few months it crept up to 173 again, then 2 weeks ago, i had a perforated appendix with an infection that had already spread in 3 quarante. following appendectomy, i was treated with iv antibiotics for 7 days. all appears to be healing well and blood work suggests infection has gone. gammagt though has gone up to 450 again. could this be the result (before appendix perforation and after) of the infection and antibiotics required? any advice or information much appreciated. thank you.
2824,in having trouble with my son and boundaries with our friends daughter and taking things from her purse i dont know what to do or how to handle it
2825,hello.    ism a 53 year old man in otherwise good shape.    ism a had overnight, 6'1'', 211 les.    i have always worked out at least four times per week.    in december, i had a cat scan which indicated an ascending aortic aneurysm of 4.7 cm.    my older sister and nephew have recently both had this condition and were both surgically treated (hers was around 5.7 and his was over 6 cm).    my up called me today and said that he wanted me to see a cards vascular surgeon for monitoring and possible treatments (i guess down the road).    my question is this:    because ism in an hm and my up is my gatekeeper (but a great do) should i get my referral to see a cards vascular surgeon or a cardiologist?    wouldn a cardiologist be a better quarterback for all heart related treatment approaches?    or, because we know i have the aneurysm, should i go straight to the surgeon?
2826,i am being worked up for chest pains/discomfort. i have periods feelings of a feeling of being punched in the center of the chest (between by breasts) which lasts for a few seconds to a few minutes.    i have never had any radiating pain and this always happens at rest. this has been happening for about 7 months.i also get a fluttering feeling, not at the same time as the above symptom, that lasts for seconds to minutes, take my breath away, might happen several times a day, or i might not have the feeling for a couple weeks.    i have had 2 negative eggs and a negative stress test.    i canst ever get to a health professional while i am actually having the symptoms because they only last for seconds to a few minutes.    the longest period i have gone with daily symptoms is three weeks, but due to the hm system i could not get to a cardiologist in time to get a holder.    i was not going through any unusual stress during this period.    now i haven had the symptoms(symptoms)for 2-3 weeks, finally got into a cardiologist and she is saying she thinks it is stress arrythmias.    we are waiting for approval for a holder monitor & she told me to contact the office when i have the fluttering, but like i said, it only lasts a few seconds.    what test can be done to catch these symptoms?how serious are arrythmias? can this lead to a heart attack? these symptoms dont happen when ism stressed out so why would it be stress arrythmias?
2827,my granddaughter aged 3 is fully toilet trained but has started soiling indiscriminately in her toyroom.    sum is very upset and shouting at her and dad is totally perplexed and doesn know what to do.    i have advised them to just clean it up, clean her up, and then carry on as usual.    i have also said that they should discreet withdraw treats but not actively punish her.    i am not sure about my advice and wonder if this behaviour is common or if there is something more serious going on.

2830,ism on birth control and i am on my last week of pills...and i always, and i mean always start my period on either monday night or tuesday morning. its thursday and still no period. i dont have any of the usual pus symptoms. i haven felt sick or had to see any more than usual...should i take a pregnancy test? me and my boyfriend live together and i dont want to freak him out if it is not necessary. and i couldn do something like that behind his back...so should i wait a few days or take one sap? ah!
2831,i was left with no choice but to complain about a group of surly medical personnel at my cardiac surgeon doctors office. well, i must/need to undergo an echo-stress test because i desperately need brain surgery for trigeminal    neuralgia, a neuropathic disease. once...again! on the day of the echo-stress exam i    faced retaliation and was 'ganged' up by 3 female workers. i asked the gal to close the privacy curtain several times, and it was never done. the testing area is for both renders. the head-charge nurse of the office was called into my testing room from several doors away and they appeared to have that knocking around, hanging up of me all planned out due to my previous fax message to the md.she yelled at me do you want to take this test or not? well.. i must have that test, or no surgery since have already had two (2) heart attacks.i fell frozen and very silent and suddenly remembered the un-wanted sexual abuse i endured one hot summer as an adolescent from an family member. its that same rotten gut feeling, like biting into an apple with a worm inside. my breasts were wide open on that table just like in my bed that morning when i was 12 years old. i froze up! org, not only did i endure un-provoked sexual advances from the most cherished male of my family, but my breasts were intentionally left wide open again for the whole world to view me in that vulnerable position again! i kept covering my breasts up and they kept pulling the gown off of my breasts! to make matters worst, the younger gal was told to take charge of me and she sand-pampered the hell out of my skin. i told them sand-tapering was unnecessary ( i have dry-dry skin, and allergic to adhesive) and she took delight in doing it even harder! i still feel the shock of that morning from both experiences, and depressed feelings are hunting me all over & once again. this new experience is just as bad as that summer morning, and even worst, because i kept saying no< no< no!i canst sleep, ism in worst pain, and    feel as emigrated all over again by my own gender. i also think the charge nurse is a drunk as well as a lesion. where do i begin? the last time i complained via fax to the md about the surly mentality,    i met this fierce gang of females taking what should be a simple echo-stress test. they also insisted that i leave my purse outside of the testing room which was totally unnecessary as there are hooks on the wall for clothes & purses. i know that if given the chance my purse including all of my is would get passed around & gripped off by at least one of them. its just the attitude in the air that one gets, you know the types, those gang mentality exist in every office setting, and lately more prominent in medical settings. who should i write to now? the hospital will protect the workers, not the patients, i do not want to sue them, i want a formal apology and they should collectively all lose their jobs. who should i make an appointment with at the center? the administration, or the doctor again, or should i make a statement to the police department. i had been violated in a doctors office and this want the first time. it happened the first time i ever saw a gynecologists at 18 years old. the doctor began to talk dirty to me and i quickly left to never return. as females, we must protect ourselves from    men, now we have to protect ourselves from lesion trunks at our doctors office too at every turn?    any suggestions would surely help this overwhelming depressed feelings that linger in my loving home.

2840,ok!    so every time i feel like i may be balancing out with my moods, i have to upgrade my dosage.    the first time i increased, i was panic for a week then crashed.    the second upgrade i was already down and got more down.    i am just starting to come back up and feel ok, to only increase again tomorrow.    i am really nervous about what will happen and how i will be.    during my second upgrade, my rage was out of control.    i had never felt that way before with such passion.    i am definitely seeing some positive things on this meditation, like the voices have stopped and i can actually get out of bed.    i dont cry and i actually can shower and go to work.    but i am ensure what normal actually feels like and therefore have no way of knowing if this is as good as it gets.    then of course, i think of my panic days and i want them back.    i want my energy.    i am reading the book, ism not crazy just bipolar    it is an awesome autobiography.    she really explained how i feel depressed and panic in my own words.    amazing.    i am trying to get all the information i can and read all the time.    i check on here all the time and then i feel like i am getting obsessed.    i just feel like there is a glimmer of hope in getting better, but it is always just out of reach.    i can remember crying at the age of twelve because i was so depressed i wanted to die.    i remember having panic attacks and breakdown and no one able to help me or understand.    i was afraid of everything and struggled with depression.    i lost friends and jobs and family.    i then turned seriously main during college.    experimenting with men and drugs to ease the pain.    for once i was not sad.    this lasted for a long time and i have been living this rollercoaster for too long.    i just want to get off.    why did it take so long for anyone to notice what was wrong with me?    why did none help?    i have so many questions and just want to be happy with going to work and coming home and being normal    i dont want to stress about the unorganized closet or the cupboards that need painting and organizing.    i dont want to count and remount my money to be sure there is enough or stay awake wondering how i will get everything done if i keep sleeping.    then i want no fog and i want to feel - being numb *****!

2842,i have been spitting up them for 4 weeks, my sinuses are always congested and full of yellow them and my neck often hurts. i have taken musinex do, cough sinus, and i keep my throat moist by sucking on cough drops constantly. i have ra and get remicaid iv infusions every six weeks. i also take methotrexate and other drugs like plaquinil daily. i have taken    antibiotics like amoxcicillin, 250mg, 3 times a day, for 10 days, and i just finished a 7 day treatment of levaquin, 500 my a day. i had a throat culture and chest gray done, and they are both negative for bacteria. my tonsils are covered in white mucus and my throat is a bit soar. i do not have a fever. could i have tuberculosis. what is this?
2843,i apologize for the lengthyness of this article, but find it best to be thorough with medical inquiries.in 2001 (age 13), i was prescribed prednisone for arthritic symptoms, and within six months i gained approximately 40 pounds. increasing amounts of the meditation quickly became ineffective. the highest dose i recall taking regularly was 20mg. ever since, i have struggled with my weight.my normal body temperature regularly came out well below 98.6 (96.8-97.5) and i became very sensitive to the cold. i dieted and exercised extensively during my first two years of high school to no avail. my junior year (age 16) i began crash-sitting, and quickly progressed to restrictive eating wherein i regularly consumed fewer than 500 calorie daily. the only times at which i have returned to a normal weight and build for my body are when i have regularly consumed fewer than 800 calorie daily, though i know this is unhealthy and my mi predict my calorie intake ought to be double that. after i ceased my restrictive behavior i began remaining weight (approximately 10 pounds per year). while this weight gain has been frustration, i have largely attributed it to beginning college.this past academic year (age 20) i remained steadily at 150lbs. within the past month however, i have gained 15lbs. while i concede that my stress level may not have helped, my eating and exercise habits did not change significantly during this time and i have regularly undergone similar levels of stress without drastic weight gain. i have had a full menstrual cycle and am not pregnant. i have not begun or ceased any meditations whatsoever. i have also become increasingly anxious/irritable, prone to headache and acid reflux, and sensitive to the cold.i am very concerned about this sudden increase in weight, as well as irritated by my steady weight gain since being prescribed prednisone, and was wondering if this might have a physical root in the thyreoid.

2855,hello,i have been having transient double vision and slurring of vision.    i have my eyes examined every year.    this year prim lenses were necessary.    what would cause double vision like this?    it is really pronounced when i am lying down or looking laterally.    i notice that when i read i usually close my right eye.
2856,this past week, i noticed that my 6 month old baby eyes are noticeably different sizes (but the pupils are the same size).    it seems like she has no vision problems with either eye.    should i take her to an ophthalmologist for further investigation?thank you in advance.

2876,i was shocked to read the news last week in a newspaper that a mother threw her children from a skyward in lumbar. isn  t it shocking to hear that? how could a mother do such a criminal activity? i also read in a business magazine that planned pregnancies are taking a big toll on the population. as high as 60% pregnancies planned? i really do not know whether its a fact or not but in a country like india this is devastating. with a plethoric of contraceptive measures available why are we not able to get what we want? you have option for both male or female. and even if its the typical carried-away moment, the i-pills of the world are always available at the next door chemist. why do people do not understand this simple procedure or are we so confident of ourselves and claim of knowing our bodies & time intercourse accordingly? i hope the new generation    the young india awaken to using contraceptive measures in a more positive manner and are completely aware of regular to emergency contraction. that  s the need of the hour!

2878,hi everyone,i need some suggestions for a valid work from home job- i need to raise some money for my if treatment. already had a fresh and frozen cycle fail, so we need to try again. thanks
2879,so i posted a question about herpes before let me explain my story. back in october i got tested for everything in my blood it was just a check it want because i was sexually active or anything. anyway the results    came out negative for have and have. in just realized this now because a took i really good look at my results back then i didn care because i want in a relationship or ever been sexually active or anything so i knew i didn have an st ll. probably within a month later i made out with this guy    the only guy i kissed within the month after my test    probably for like 10 minutes. ll ism 19 bow. anyway i was under clot of stress that    week also i couldn sleep want eating right i was crying clot i was really depressed / stressed out that week i felt me getting sick because of all my stress.within a week later i started to develop something inside my mouth not my lips it was weird i felt a slight tingling and then i looked inside my mouth i saw a small shallow ulcer it was inside my mouth it want on my gums or the roof of my mouth it was like on the really soft part of    my mouth like when you pull down or lip that soft part. ink why but the first thing that came to my mind was a coldsore    i showed my mon and she told me that not a cold sore ink what that is but its not a coldsore considering i got tested for have and it came back negative a month prior to this you would think its not a coldsore but i was ignorant and had no idea what have was. it hurt when i talked and ate it was unbearable and i had lip swelling so i went to the doctor and told her i think this a coldsore! ll i just told her she looked at it quickly and agreed. my point is i feel like the doctor was wrong this happen over 7 months ago i started searching and i think what i had was a cancer sore. i told my mon about it and she says she never thought it was a coldsore she felt the doctor was wrong. cancer sores i read can be trigger because of stress can cause lip swelling and appear in the mouth coldsores can appear inside the mouth also however (rarely) but even then its usually on the gums,hard follette or roof of the mouth. mine was on the soft part of my mouth when you pull your lip down. i did have tingling but i read cancer sores also can give you a tingling feeling before they start. ism almost 100% sure it was a cancer sore but you know the doctor said it was a coldsore. in my testing results i came out negative for the coldsore virus but then a month later i get a coldsore i feel like there no sense in that. i mean i did make out with one guy after those tests but he had no sores or anything or his lips.however that why i feel the    doctor can be    wrong. i did my research on coldsores and cankersore and from the description i gave you guns here ism almost 100 percent sure it was a cankersore. if the doctor was wrong honestly ism furious because she had me thinking i had oral herpes when i didn but anyway can anyone put some input for me here i would like to get some opinions and help me i canst talk to my mon about this ll    bow the reason why i care so much is because ism now in a serious relationship its been 4 months just recently about a week ago i made him get tested so if we get sexually active i know hers clean. my boyfriend came out completely clean for everything including have and have. ( hers the only guy i kissed after the cankersore or whatever it was ll )that why i care so much. ism pretty sure ism have negative now but i    also just want input. thankyouu =)

2900,why are members of the secular media soft on muslin but merciless on christians ,the answer is simpler than you think its cowardice,fear of swift islamic retribution and retaliation has kept the secular media in the west hiding in their proverbial 'foxholes' fear is a very powerful    fact of life ,attacking christians has become fashionable ,you need only to read the back webster on any given    day ,you will find countless examples of condemnation of christians around the globe .it is safer to pick on christians,after all the essence of their faith is love , forgiveness and peacemaking.they would never respond in the same fashion to their muslin counterpart .the secular media has come to realise that their accusations will not be challenged since the tenants of the christian faith are to love our enemies and bless our persecutors .

2922,first national tea party convention in nashville, to, last night...    this judge roy moore was on fire !    he cited such patriots as thomas paine, james madison, samuel adams and patrick henry and he received four standing ovations during his impassioned speech.    this guy, roy moore, is running for governor of alabama.he then began to paraphrase the declaration of independence. but rather than addressing grievances to the king of britain, moore presented drama with his own bill of particulars:he has ignored our history and our heritage, arrogant declaring to the world that we are no longer a christian nation. hers elevated immortality to a new level, setting aside the entire month of june last to celebrate gay, lesion, sexual and transgender pride.he now threatens to change our law, 10 u.s.c. section 654, to allow homosexuality in our military in direct opposition to the law which says that the attempt to engage in homosexuality will create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline and unit adhesion that are the essence of military capability.he has apologized to the arab world for our past, subjugated our national sovereignty by bowing down to the king of said arabia.he has pursued a socialist agenda by taking control of private companies and pushing a national health-care plan with a public option. backed by a willing congress, he has bought off our senators and our representatives with our own money in an effort to mandate this agenda. and when opposed by members of the senate, he snugly smiled and said, i won.moore concluded his list with a direct quote from the declaration: a prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.***posted: february 05, 201011:50 pm eastern on and.com***

2928,washington (asp)    new claims for us unemployment benefits jumped more than expected last week, official data showed thursday on the eve of the key june jobs report.initial claims for bless benefits rose to a personally adjusted 472,000 in the week ending june 26, an increase of 13,000 from the previous weeks upwards revised level of 459,000, the labor department said.the leap was sharply higher than the consensus analyst forecast of 458,000 claims.the four-week moving average, which helps smooth out weekly volatility, rose 0.7 percent to 466,500.the trend has generally been moving higher in recent weeks, suggesting that the labor market is perhaps starting to weaken, said andrew gledhill at moods economy.com.in the previous week ending june 19, the insured unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, unchanged from the prior weeks revised rate, the department said.the number of people collecting unemployment insurance benefits in the week to june 19 rose by 43,000 to 4,616,000, while the four-week moving average slipped 0.5 percent to 4,567,500.gledhill called recent moves in claims troubling.in typical job market recovered, claims would be much lower -- below 400,000 -- but in the current situation they have remained stubbornly elevated. part of the explanation is that hiring is very low, potentially prompting a greater share of unemployed than is typical to file for benefits coming out of a recession.the weekly bless claims data came on the eve of the departments key june jobs report, widely expected to show worsening conditions.most analysis expect the data friday will show the unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent in may, and the economy shed 100,000 confirm jobs after adding 431,000 in the prior month, mainly temporary government jobs for the 2010 census.
2929,have been trying to get pregnant for the past 3 years and do far no luck. the doctors have done so many test to find out why, to make story short, the diagnose me with small cyst then 2 years later with a small fibroid, which they said that that could be the reason, so the send me to a fertility and they did the sg that came out great no tubes close. so, on sept i started taking conception tea, i been using it for a month an half and next month the doctors want me to start with my first treatment of closed 50mg. my question is if anyone knows if i could take the conception tea and closed together?
2930,i had my thyreoid radiated several years ago and i am on synthroid. my current dose is 137, 5 and 1/2 pills a week. i just had my third failed if cycle(i did achieve pregnancy in dec. and miscarried at 7 weeks). the problem is my thyreoid is under 2 at the beginning of the cycle and 6 weeks later was 3.54. i know the birth control pill does interfere with the thyreoid levels. so how do i keep my thyreoid in range while i am on the bc, upon, menopur and goal-f. so, how do i figure out how much to increase the dose of synthroid while i am on these beds?

2933,hello ladies! ism 37 weeks pregnant and have dilated cm, tramping a lot. i have read on here that many have had ultrasounds later in pregnancy, but i honestly haven had one since early in my last trimester. is that normal, or should i say something to the doctor? i have a different doctor with this pregnancy than i had with my last, the last one did many throughout. i am getting nervous now that were nearing the end. i just want her to be healthy!
2934,just a quick question for you ladies.    what do you think my chances of getting peggy are when i had sex on the days that i was emulating but my do pulled out?? in having some extreme fatigue, back ache and some random nausea, and of is due on sat. thanks in advance for you responses!!
2935,in trying to conceive(conceive)and me and my husband had unprotcted sex on aug 30-aug and i lobulated aug rd and lately my breast has been hurting and having a weird tingling feeling in them..i got my period a week early i got it on aug with could this be implantation bleeding? when can i take    a pregnancy test???
2936,i had some thoughts that i might be pregnant because of few weeks of break in contraction but as i started to take my pill again, i had no symptoms of pregnancy. i come on my period and on the first bleed i think have might passed down something like product of conception. but there was no strong pain stomach. just a normal pain in stomach and in back. what is the tissue which have passed down? could it be a product of conception or something else and what it could be ? ism really confused about it but canst stop thinking what it was...
2937,this is to the ones that trying etc. hopefully this will help u all.if you are on a 28 day cycle, your most fertile time can be 14 days after the first day of your last of....but if you are irregular that is not the case....the period of time from the first day of a woman period and population can vary greatly, its the legal phase(time from population to menstruation) that doesn vary as greatly....a woman usually always starts her period 10 to 16 days after population. so if you have a 25 day cycle, you could ovulate anywhere from do to d 15.....if you have a 30 day cycle, you could ovulate anywhere from d 14 to d 20. if you have a 35 day cycle you could ovulate anywhere from cd19 to d 25.....and this could vary from month to month, but it will usually be somewhere within that time frame...also, your body could go haywire one month and not ovulate til really late or ovulate really early...but then you should expect your period to either come really late(for late population) or really early(for early population) as that 10 to 16 day period doesn change. i hope this makes sense!
2938,i just had two positive home pregnancy tests and my friend did a test on me that checks for a baby heart beat. fatal monitor test i think is what the name for it is. anyway.. it showed a heart beat of 130, which is supposedly normal for a baby. i couldn get in the doctor today, so i took another test that showed negative? ism confused, the only thing i know about pregnancy really is have had one miscarriage. i have felt different lately, i just dont know what to think after having the negative test.

2961,my daughter has been ill for four weeks. she was admitted into hospital after two weeks of a diarrhoea for one week, vomiting for another week. then she had a sore throat and a temperature of 39.9. she was put on a drip for dehydration and had her bc checked which came back at 300. she had a clear result from her urine and a scan of her bowel suggested a slight inflammation, as did her bladder, but no conclusive diagnosis. she has a bloated stomach and has done for months. she is also very pale and tired. she was discharged from hospital as her fever dropped. it is now 39 again, she has developed a cough and is wheels. she has been on both iv and oral antibiotics for 2 weeks but is still not better. i am concerned that her bc was not re-taken after her fever came down and that such a high level may be indicative of something else. what should i do now?
2962,if your moving to a newly built house, say goodby to mail delivery at your door.and if some house republicans get their way, all door-to-door mail delivery will go away.the u.s. postal service is marching towards a more centralized delivery, where residents pick up their own mail from clusters of mail boxes located in their neighborhood. local postmaster are sending hundreds of letters to fast-growing communities, warning that cluster boxes will be the way mail will be delivered to new developments.in the past year, the cash-strapped postal service has been asking companies in industrial parts and shopping walls to also adopt this form of mail delivery.but rep. barrel isa, the california republican leading the house effort to save the postal service, wants more. he has made doing away with footstep delivery a key part of his bill, which would require everyone to get mail at a subside box or from a cluster box.a balanced approach to saving the postal service means allowing uses to adapt to americans changing use of mail, said isa, who is chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee.moving away from door-to-door delivery saves a lot of money. right now, 35 million residences and business get mail delivered to their footstep.it costs $353 per stop for a delivery in most american cities, taking into account such things as salaries and cost of transport. by contrast, subside mail box delivery costs $224, while cluster boxes cost $160, according to a report from the postal services office of inspector general.delivering mail is the agencies largest fixed cost -- $30 billion. ending such door delivered would save $4.5 billion a year. that more than the $3 billion it would have saved from ending saturday mail service, according to government reports.related: los angeles is worst for mail carrier dog bitesthat's why ending door delivery has drawn industry support from groups like the greeting card association, which supports saturday service.but unions say its a bad idea to end delivery to footsteps and will be disruption for the elderly and disabled.its madness, said jim saber, chief of staff for the national association of letter carriers. the idea that somebody is going to walk down to their mailbox in buffalo, new york, in the winter snow to get their mail is just crazy.yet postal officials say everything on the table, when it comes to cost-cutting. earlier this year, it tried to end saturday mail delivery, but later reversed its decision.uses fails to deliver $5.5 billionusps fails to deliver $5.5 millionth postal service continues to struggle with mail volume, especially drops in first-class mail, its big revenue driver, as more americans move to electronic filling and e-failing.in 2012, the agency lost $16 billion. last year, the agency twice default on payments owed to the federal government to refund retired health care benefits toiling $11 billion. the agency has also exhausted a $15 billion line of credit from the u.s. treasury.ending a congressional mandate to make large annual payments toward retired health care benefits would help solve the agencies woes.as it awaits for help from congress, the postal agency has been trying to do what it can on its own. one of the initiatives is pushing cluster boxes on new developments.prior to this spring, weed work with the construction companies and they could decide if the houses would get cluster boxes or curling delivery --- now the postal service makes that decision, said postal service spokesman sue brennan.related: wave of federal retires to hit government cranberry, pa., the community is up in arms after getting a letter in april from the postal service saying cluster boxes would be going in new developments.community leaders say they understand the boxes are cheaper but they want a better plan that takes into account safety, access and maintenance. township leaders and the postal service are holding talks over the boxes.we understand what driving this is a cost savings, said cranberry township manager merry andrew. but you canst just take a cluster box and drop it into the community without planning for its safety, use and access.for now, residents already receiving door delivery will see no change, unless the route is deemed dangerous because a dog bites a milan or congress changes the law, said seven hopkins, a professor of literature at new york university, and a postal service expert.the big thing will be if they get approval in legislation to make the switch for existing door delivery customers, said hopkins, who writes the blow save the post office.http://money.can.com/2013/07/23/news/economy/postal-home-delivery/index.html?did=h_e_news

2970,may 25, 2010relations between north and south more deteriorated to their worst condition in years as pyongyang announced it would cut all ties with soul and expel some south organs working at a joint industrial park in the border city of kaesong.heard on morning edition:the reaction came amid rising tension after an investigation report concluded that north more was to blame for sinking a south organ naval vessel in march, killing 46 sailors.south more on tuesday resumed propaganda broadcast across the north-south border. the north has threatened to fire artillery shells at south organ loudspeakers used in the broadcast. pyongyang also said it will resume its own broadcast.reports also said the north had ordered its military on high alert and that south organ ships and aircraft would be prohibited from passing through its territory.restrictions on trade, traveling addition to taking its complaint against north more to the u.n. security council, south organ president lee young-back said monday that his country would cut off much of its trade with the north.lee also said north organ merchant vessels will no longer be allowed to use a shortest through south organ waters, a move that would force the north organ ships to expend more time and fuel.but analysis say the measures wont be enough to change the north behavior.an international investigation found that the explosion of the south organ warship conan on march 26 was caused by a topped launched from a north organ submarine.north more has denied any involvement in the sinking and said it would treat the south retaliatory measures as an act of war.u.s. backs south, looks to u.n. actionthe united states has fully backed its ally south more. secretary of state axillary clinton was in being tuesday seeking support from china on u.n. security council action against north more. she was headed later tuesday for meetings wednesday in soul.the united states maintains a deterred force of about 28,500 troops in south more, a military legacy from the 1950-53 organ war, which ended with an uneasy armistice.analysis say the real danger amid the current tension may come if north organ ships decide to test the south organ blockade, running the risk of provoking another conflict at sea. in what may be an effort to warn the north organs away from such a confrontation, the pentagon has said the u.s. navy would join south korea's navy in anti-submarine-warfare exercises in the near future.given north korea's bellicose statements so far, its not clear how its military would react in a confrontation at sea.i think everybody trying to get the mix just right, says thomas husband, a former u.s. ambassador to south more. to have measures that are strong enough to teach a lesson, but not so strong as to create a retaliatory cycle.will sanction hurt north more?north more exports minerals, such as construction sand, and some farm products to the south. the loss of that trade could amount to more than $250 million a year. that relatively tiny by the standards of most industrial countries, but because the north is so impoverished, experts say the loss will be felt.enlargejung yon-je/asp/petty images south organ protested burns a north organ flag with an image of north organ leader him long il during a rally in soul on tuesday. south more has imposed trade sanction on the north for alleged sinking a southern naval vessel.that enough to have an impact on north korea's economy, says analyst jack pritchard, but it wont be a decisive impact. even so, pritchard, the president of the more economic institute in washington, says the sanction are a necessary step to express south organ anger over the attack.pritchard says the south action leaves north more in a weaker position, with little trade beyond what it has with its major trading partner, china.north korea's trade with the south was a source of foreign exchange currency, which the north then used to buy items such as fuel and machinery from china, commodities that are especially important to the north large military.but the trade situation between the north and south has been deteriorating over the more than two years that lee has been in office, says charles armstrong, director of the center for organ studies at columbia university.a former executive at hyundai corps., lee is a conservative politician who has taken a rougher line on north more than several of his predecessors. trade between the two countries fell by an estimated 10 percent last year.china steps inarmstrong notes that china already has wide investments in north more, and he says it will probably take up much of the slack caused by the south organ trade cuff. both china and south more view the north as an important source of low-cost labor.one major exception to the trade cuff is the kaesong industrial complex, an area in north more where more than a dozen south organ companies have built or are building manufacturing plants to be stuffed by north organ workers.activity at the kaesong complex amounts to more than half the trade between the two countries.its already a significant source of income for the north, where workers are believed to earn a total of more than $40 million a year in hard currency wages. south organ economists believe it could eventually employ more than 700,000 north organ workers.husband says south more would be reluctant to shut the project down. more than trade, [the south organs] see this as laying the basis for future relations, husband says.he adds that if the kaesong complex were shut down, the loss of jobs would very likely stir a strong public reaction that even the north organ leadership would have to pay attention to.one thing that not clear to economists is how much criminal activity contributes to north korea's economy.according to the u.s. state department, north more is also thought to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from the reported sale of missiles, narcotics and counterfeit cigarettes and currency.

3021,i have braces on my teeth and have metal bands around 4 of my molars (1 in each quarante) where the braces attach. on the two bottom molars, the teeth look kind of greyish instead of white. they sometimes hurt when ism eating, but i dont know if that just because they are moving with the braces etc. i dont see any holes in the top of the teeth, but with the band around them i canst see the sides of them to check for any holes. does it sound like i have cavities in these teeth? maybe a hole underneath the metal bands has let decay get into the teeth or something and that why they dont look white anymore?

3024,does tylenol worse asthma for kiss?nor 20 feb 2012http://www.nor.org/blows/health/2012/02/20/147002356/does-tylenol-worse-asthma-for-kidsparents and doctors around the world have been alarmed by the dramatic increase in childhood asthma.one factor in the upswing is better detection by doctors, but at least one doctor thinks a common over-the-counter drug also has something to do with it.dr. john bride sees lots of kiss with asthma. hers a pediatric pulmonologist at akron children hospital in ohio. he knew of studies that raised concern about the safety of acetaminophen    brand name tylenol    to treat cold and fever in kiss with asthma. so he decided to look more closely at the research.i was stunned, he says. all the studies he looked at showed a link between asthma and acetaminophen.the more acetaminophen somebody takes, the more likely it is that they have asthma, he says. also, there an incredible consistency. everybody around the world who looked for this association has been able to find it.in asthma, the always of the lungs get blocked by mucous and narrow. that leads to wheeling and shortness of breath. the rise in asthma has closely parallel the increased use of acetaminophen.there are no scientific studies proving the meditation causes asthma, but bride says it may make asthma worse in kiss who already have it.nine-month-old matter cough and wheels as bride examines him and talks with his mon, ceased moore, about his asthma. he cough. he wheels. there are multiple symptoms, she says. he works very hard to breathe. when hers excited from crawling or even laughing, then he breathes really hard.in the past when matter got a cold, moore gave him tylenol. but that seemed to make his symptoms worse. at mcbride's suggestion, she stopped using it. then one day, her aunt was looking after matter when he had a cold.i told her dont give him tylenol, moore says. i didn specify that it was acetaminophen. she actually gave him a cold medicine, but it seemed to make him kind of worse. i looked at the active ingredient and acetaminophen was in the active ingredient.in fact, acetaminophen is an ingredient in many cough and cold products    including nyquil, robitussin and theraflu. it might exacerbate the asthma because it decreases levels of a molecule called glutathione, which protects the lungs.so removing the beneficial effect of glutathione exactly at a time children lungs are being irritated might end up being just one factor that contributes to the onset of an asthma attack, bride says.mcbride's recommendation? dont give acetaminophen to a child who has asthma. other doctors say its too soon for that advice.many other factors could play a role in the rise of asthma, according to dr. stanley seller, head of pediatric pharmacology at national jewish health in denver. vitamin d insufficiency, dietary changes, air pollution or better control of infections are perhaps all related to the increasing prevalence of asthma, he says.johnson & johnson, maker of tylenol, said in a statement that the medicine has been used safely and effectively for more than 50 years. there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies that show a causal link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in tylenol, and asthma, the company said.its important to control a child fever, seller says. bride agrees but says ibuprofen is a safer bet    at least until going studies provide answers about the safety of acetaminophen for kiss with asthma.

3040,chicago (cubs)    the president of the south suburban branch of the nap alleged a director of the re-election campaign of back drama has threatened and intimidated him because he doesn  t support the president.david lower says he believes he was threatened during a phone conversation with louis raymond, the illinois political director for drama for america.lower says he doesn  t personally support the president because he  s not addressing issues important to the black community. he said he was explaining that to raymond when the drama campaign official told him,   you know what? i know everything about you.  lower says raymond added,   we  ve been watching you, and since you don  t support drama, we  ll deal with you,   before hanging up.lower filed a report with the oak forest police report, he says,   in case something happens.  he says it was suggested the nap should automatically back the president. lower notes a non-profit cannot support a particular candidate.he says it  s a clear signal the drama campaign is concerned about the black vote.lower hosts an internet radio program called   let the truth be told,   where he  s made no secret of his displeasure with the president.louis raymond declined to comment. the drama re-election campaign issued a written statement in response to lower  s claims.  unfortunately there seems to have been a miscommunication regarding this conversation and we have since discussed with the campaign staff in an effort to clarify the matter. the president continues to support the mission and principles of the nap and the work they do,   the statement said.lower says he  s not for money, either.http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/10/04/nap-official-drama-campaign-staff-threatened-me/

3043,i have cold. i got a cold and it was on its way to turning into pneumonia. i went to the doctor. i was given some kind of antibiotic shot in the butt, and then sent home with three doses (days) of azithromycin (500 my per dose). i was also put on blood pressure meditation for the first time. it is lisinopril, 10 my in the morning and evening. other than this i take spirit once a day and use albuterol by nebulizer. i also take many supplement every day.i was fine yesterday after going to the doctor, in fact felt like a new person shortly after and i am assuming this is due to that shot they gave me. i felt great this morning when i went back to the doctor for a short re-check. i have another appointment for next monday.the problem began after i got home from my appointment, ind say around 2 p.m. suddenly i have diarrhoea. its not that i have to run to the bathroom every 15 minutes, but seems to be simply that i had a bowel movement and it was basically brown water. i had a very normal bowel movement last evening. then i started noticing last evening that when i had to go to the bathroom, not much was coming. and today its worse. at this point there is no pain, and not even a lot of discomfort. but i do feel i have to go and when i attempt to only a few trickles, or nothing comes.could this be from that antibiotic shot they gave me, or could it be from the azithromycin or lisinopril, or a combination? ism a bit frightened and not sure what to you. i live in a small rural town with a clinic. the doctor i seen will not be back here now until next monday.i would appreciate some input on this, please.

3045,hi everyone,as i have researches success stories about taking closed, i have learned that most woman that become pregnant off of using closed, have had specific reasons for taking it. for example, someone with cos who takes closed, typically will conceive, since the closed is fixing the problem.in my situation, i believe i had a short gluteal phase, periods 24 to 26 days apart, therefore, after my doctor ran the tube test on me and my tubes are good and then he tested my boyfriend speak and his ll swimmer are good, well, he put me on closed. he never did any tests regarding my population before the closed, i am now on my second cycle of closed. i am wondering if he automatically assumed that my problem was the short gluteal phase. i have read that a short gluteal phase could prevent implantation and that i very well may have conceived before but it could have passed through my cycle.i guess i am just wondering if the closed will help me if a short gluteal phase is my problem? does anyone have any feedback? please help!! i would love to hear anyone success stories behind closed fixing their short gluteal phase and actually concerning. i really appreciate it in advance!!

3065,maiden is now 15 months old and can crawl on his hands and knees, sit up on his own and can pull up on furniture or our legs to stand. he cannot remain standing if he lets go, and cannot walk. he does have a baby walker (like adults use, only outer, with toys etc.) he loves it because he can walk behind it without falling. if you watch him from behind when he walks you can see that he walks on the sides of his feet. the physical therapy people say its because his ankles are weak. (my oldest son was born with clubfeet so my daughter thinks it is probably an inherited family issue.) his pediatrician and his early intervention people have never said anything about the shape of his feet, they only say his ankle muscles are weak. it seems to me that if his feet were misshapen they would have noticed before now. having dealt with my sons clubfeet i dont see any resemblance, however i suppose its possible. maiden still canst localise very well and only occasionally uses consonant sounds. the it people are having them use sign language with him. why?

3071,london (asp)    british foreign secretary william hague spoke out thursday against the medieval planned storing to death for adultery of a woman in ran, saying it would disgust and appeal the rest of the world.hague commented on the case of 43-year-old saline mohammadi-ashtiani. human rights group amnesty international has said she was convicted in 2006 or 2007 and has previously received a flogging of 99 lashes.ism appalled by reports of the imminent execution, hague said at a press conference in london alongside turkish foreign minister met davutoglu.i think that storing is a medieval punishment that has no place in the modern world and the continued use of such a punishment in ran demonstrates in our view a latent disregard for human rights.he added: i do call on ran to put an immediate stay to this execution and review the process by which this woman is tried and i think if this punishment were carried out, it would disgust and appeal the watching world.davutoglu was asked whether turkey would raise the case with ran.were trying to work and consult on all these issues with our neighbour ran, of course we have to see the file, he said.the case was also raised in britain house of commons, prompting speaker john below to describe it as a horrified, truly horrified matter.we in this house, i hope, are in favour of human rights, not of their grotesque abuse, he added.amnesty has called on the italian authorities to halt all executions and commune all death sentences.it says that saline mohammadi-ashtiani, who has two children, could be at imminent risk of execution.it is highlighting her case alongside that of furnish political activist zeynab jalalian, who was sentenced to death last year.
3072,i have recently had two urine drug screens come back showing trace amounts of oxycodone.    i have not taken this drug.    i suffer from severe chronic pain in my back and have been prescribed dilaudid for almost 3 years, which i take regularly on a daily basis and without it i am totally bedridden.    i recently changed doctors and as part of a provincial program for regular use of controlled narcotics, i have to submit to random drug screens to prove i do not use illicit (street) drugs or any meditations that are not prescribed to me and that patients who are prescribed narcotics are not selling them and not taking them.    i am absolutely fine with this program and confident submitting to the testing because i take my prescribed meditation regularly and have absolutely nothing to hide.    i have submitted two samples of urine on two different occasions 6-8 weeks apart and both results came back showing my dilaudid but also showing *trace* amounts of oxycodone in my urine sample.    why could this be happening to me?    it is threatening my treatment and making me look dishonest to my new doctor, as people who do use drugs they are not prescribed and street drugs always say they didn use them when their results come back positive.    of course, i am telling him this as well and he is saying every patient he has will deny they didn[t do the drug when their screen comes back positive, just like i am saying to him!!    i need to know what i can suggest as testing to prove it is something in my system causing this false-positive result and also an explanation for him why it is showing trace amounts of oxycodone when i have not taken any of this drug.    medially, i usually have protein in my urine on testing in small amounts from kidney damage years ago and have rheumatoid arthritis.    i have no other medical conditions that i know of, which is also a concern, as i am worried because i have read so much online that this test result may mean something is awry in my system and showing up in a different way....(eg: diabetes, kidney failure etc).    can someone with expertise in the lab testing area please help me bring some information forward to my doctor in terms of what i should be tested for as i may have a rare molecule in my urine etc........this is threatening my treatment with my regularly prescribed meditation and i have to prove i am not taking any oxycodone and not lying about it.    please help if you know anything i can research or suggest to him that we test for.
3073,at 12 weeks and 6 days i started to bleed heavily but no pain.    i had to rush to the hospital because the amount of blood i lost was abnormal.    after having been checked by 2 doctors and after having 4 ultrasounds we found out that i have blood clots on the wall of my uterus.    we heard the baby heart beat and everything was ok.    the only problem was that the blood clots were taking up 50% of space on the uterus.    they told me that i haven done anything to cause this and that it is mother nature.    things like this can happen.    so they told me that i have to be a couch potato.    no straining, no abrupt movements, no lifting.    i had to go back 2 weeks later for another ultrasound.    the blood clots are down to 10%.    they were very happy.    i am still bleeding but it is brown.    they told me that that is old blood.    my doctor even said that i might bleed throughout my entire pregnancy.    now i am 15 weeks and 6 days and i am still on bed rest.    i have to go for ultrasouns every 2 weeks.anyone else in the same situation?
3074,me and my partner have been together for 6 six months. i was tested for st before we started sleeping together protected and was given the all clear apart from a bacterial infection that was treated.when we have sex he gets red saws on his penis. he says that they are very painful for day or 2 and form scabs could this be from friction during sex? or should i get tested again? or could it be something to do with bacterial infection.

3080,i had retina detachment (pp with gas bubble) surgery in my right eye almost 3 mon ago.    it took a while..over 2 mon before the blood in my eye started going away.    2 weeks ago, my do found a small retina tear in my right eye in which he altered.    he said i now have new blood in the same eye because of the retina tear.i now have a patch (looks like the map of texas) of blood (i hope it is) blocking my vision in the same operated eye.    it seems to be getting smaller very very slowly.    the edges of the patch seems thinner and i can still see blood/dust/black dots floating/swimming in my eye.    my vision around the patch cleared up a lot since my surgery after almost three months ago.    i can read and see around the patch.    but i think i already started seeing this patch 2 months after my surgery.    however, the doctor didn see the retina tear until the blood started subsiding 2 months after my surgery.1) is it still really blood still blocking my vision on the operated eye?    it is in the same spot in my eye?    in just nervous because it is taking a while to subside.    give researches a lot on this beside and because of all the reading give done in thinking it could be worse or more than just blood.2) how long until blood could subside in your eye?thanks in advance for your response.    i appreciate it.
3081,i keep getting what seems like a blister on the lower part of the back of my mouth behind my wisdom teeth.    i can pop the small sister and then it simply returns a few days later.    it has been coming back for almost 4 months now.    it is not painful, but i want to understand what it is.i thought it could be contributed to me still having my wisdom teeth as the blister is just behind when my back tooth is.    my dentist dismissed this idea and said it would go away on it'sown.    it hasn.    i am hoping someone can shed some light on this topic.thank you,canal

3090,there is incidentally noted a hyperechoic area within the posterior thigh measuring 2.5 cm in length x 6 mm in length of uncertain etiology. this is within the muscular and may reflect a haematoma. this could reflect scar tissue. the appearance is not suggestive of a lymph node.overall appearance is benign. however, correlation and follow up are recommended as clinically appropriate.the above paragraph is what was on the report, i have no idea what it means. note that i have had a small lump in the back of my mid thigh for about 3 months now and no one seems to know what it is.. no color change no warmth to the area just a lump with pain and softness, horses when i walk or stand. what does all of    this mean??

3093,i am 28 and have been ex. pain that started on the right side of my left breast about four months ago. i didn injure it but i thought i might have so i have given it some time to heal. however, i had the fly over the fourth of july and was at a funeral and my breast/chest hurt very badly along with extreme dizziness and feeling like i didn drink my ve juice (you know where they walk sideways because they didn have their ve). i felt like/sometimes still do, feel like ism just going to couple over.    but i didn have it checked. over the past four months, this pain has grown from that originating spot, up, above my left breast, up through to my collar bone on top, over to my far left shoulder tip (to where the shoulder looks a little dislocated), and esp. hurts in my armpit/breast region. i also have had pain under my left breast, by where i think the rib cage ends. there is a protrusion there, like the bottom of my rib cage has a bit of bone that sticks out. that started about seven years ago. i had a no look at it and she felt it too. my right side is not like that. i have had problems wearing brass because of this. there was a mammogram and cat scan done back then, but everything was fine and the no said she didn know what is was. i was young and have been living with that pain for a while and didn insist on getting an answer.    it goes into my back shoulder blade, where it hurts to breathe lately. today, my current no ordered x-rays of my shoulder although i told her it felt like my glands were swollen. the x-rays were fine. has anybody had something similar or maybe have an sinking of how i can approach firing this out? i will do the mammogram and utlrasound the no has set up for me, but what if this shows nothing? its like they tell you you waited to long to come to the doctor for pain relief but other times they tell you you came too soon. screwed if you do and screwed if you dont. i dont want to do anything crazy but this pain is limiting my life-i can pretty much only lay in bed because if ism asleep then i wont have to deal with the terrible pain. any help would be greatly appreciated.
3094,please can someone help. my daughter of 9 complained 3 days ago with sudden eye pain, and double vision. her right side of her face is also very swollen. my first thoughts were lumps but she has no pain.i took her to the up immediately who prescribed antibiotics, the next day i was not happy with her behaviour as she lifts her chin up to the right side when she walks and talks. she also act strange almost like she is not looking me in the eyes when i talk to her, she also seems very lethargy, and when she walks it looks like she is not moving her arms.i did take her to the pediatrician who could not find anything wrong with her, besides the swollen right side of her face, but he does not know her, and i know this is not the way she is suppose to act.i am so worried, can i demand a mr scan from the pediatrician? i am not sure where to go from hereplease please...i need advice
3095,i am 31 years old i have iron and colic acid deficient anaemia, along with that i have extreme fatigue to the point i could sleep 15 or more hours continuously, with that comes with the loss of sex drive. i have had a headache for 1 month it stopped hurting for about 4 hours after the er gave me an iv with corridor. i also have left upper abdominal burning and pain, i have not been able to function normally for about a month and have no idea what to do next. they have completed blood work and so far the only thing that came back was anaemia. the er completed a it scan of my head and they said it was normal, they have prescribed percocet to me for the head ache which is not helping by the way. i am not one of the people who like the feeling of being dragged i would prefer someone find out what is wrong and help fix me then drug me. does anyone have any idea what this may be?    i have not told my dr about the pain because when i went for all of the other symptoms i was not having that pain. my mother told me 2 days ago that her grandmother passed away from leukaemia so that has me worried as well. about 6 years ago i had my gallbladder removed so in almost certain it is nothing to do with that.

3105,well, you should be done with the et, but probably still at the hospital on nearest.    ism sure that everything went very well for you. congress and lots of nearest now!!i wanted to tell you about his.    here a webster i found with a neat chart to let you know symptoms and what to do.http://www.if.com/his.htmlthe webster is not the clinic i used, but my clinic gave me a chart similar to this one.    basically, my clinic had me keep a log of my weight, morning and night weight, to ensure that i didn gain 5# in one day (your note it to morning it).    also, trying to keep salt intake down will help to keep from retaining the fluid as well.let me know if you need any more into.    i hope i didn scare you by this, but i think its good to know, in case you do start to experience the symptoms.    i could tell a difference 9 days after the transfer, i felt more bloated than before the er.    i called the office to talk to them about it on day 12 just to make sure that everything was fine.     and, like i said, the main thing is take it easy if you can, and stay hydrate.    those two things alone will help.good luck to you.....all the best...said x 2    :)

3111,hello ladies,as you all know, i was schedule for an induction friday am.    however, little miss decided to make her entrance thursday at 11:24 am.    i was very glad to go into labour naturally.i woke up at 3:45, just feeling off.    by 4:30 i was sure i was in labour so i woke my do, called l & d and headed over.    by the time we got there the contractions were 4-5 minutes apart.once in l & d, the of team checked in on me, because of the complications with my is they and the beds team were on stand for when i actually delivered.    i refused an epi at first, but about an hour later, after a great, information discussion with my nurse i decided to have one.    my main concern was having pain relief in place if i had complications again.    the epi did slow down my contractions, but my do just decided to let it unfold, i guess a lot of docs will give pitocin when that happens.    when i was 9 cm she broke my water and i was ready to push.i pushed for a little over two hours.    at one point my epi needle came out so i was au natural for the actual delivery.    i was beginning to think i would have medical intervention again....my do kept saying you are making progress, slow progress but lets try for another 10 minutes....    and just as they were entering the room, i pushed her out.

3112,ism 24 years old, and pregnant for the first time. with insult resistance. ism almost 27 weeks and have managed glucose control perfectly with diet and exercise. to attain even better control though, around 20 weeks my naturopath put me on 300mcg of chromic a day. ism also taking 2000mg of metformin.obviously glucose control gets harder during the third trimester. have gradually increased my chromic intake over the last 7 weeks. ism currently taking 2500mcg - 3000mcg a day now. without it, my control isn that the best (still not enough for insult usage, but ism trying to avoid insult therapy at all costs anyway).have growled, but cannot find any relevant information. can taking <3000mcg of chromic utf a day be harmful to my child? ind imagine uncontrolled blood sugar would outweigh the risks of overlying it on the chromic, right?. and ind assume a vitamin is better than adding more meditation into my diet?

3125,let me begin by giving a little background. i am a recent college graduate. i have moved back home for the next few months until i begin graduate school. while i am at home i have a lot of down time, and was really struggling to find a job and my way here. my boyfriend has been fairly patient through my up and down. he has stood by me through a lot. we have been together almost three years now. admittedly i am a bit neurotic. but lately i have been trying very hard to keep my bad habits, checking up all the time for example, in check. he still has another year left in school so it is really hard being away from him. but right before i left and continuing on until now we have been having a lot of trouble. we have been fighting a lot. honestly the fights are usually brought on by me being neurotic, but lately i feel like he is initiating these fights. and the way he argues with me feels unfair and harmful. i will usually say something to him, sometimes a little sappy but never anything big, and he will blow up and start yelling or sending texts in all caps. then he will refuse to apologize or take responsibility.i love him a lot. but ism scared us being together isn right now that we are apart.... for an undetermined amount of time. i know its not possible to know for sure what to do. but am i reading into these fights to much, is this normal? i want to be with him but i canst always tell whether i am being to critical or something is really wrong.

3143,i have a quiet type 13 year old daughter. she seldom would sit down and have casual conversation with me and her mon. she would prefer chatting, or testing friends in her room. one day, i called her attention so that we can talked on what was going on. i made it clear to her that while in school you can have all the opportunity and time for bending with school mates, but once you are out of the school premises the focus for bending is with us, your parents. this house rule was not followed so i regulated her internet use and confiscated her telephone. after several months, i found out that she acquired a telephone and was testing a male friend. i scolded her for this because there is a prior instruction to distance herself from male friends. as a result, she has become more evasive, and communicating with her has become more difficult even if i tried to forget what had happened and tried to restore a loving relationship. what must i do next?

3145,i am a 34 year old female and only 100 pounds. i have always been thin (and many of my friends and family say blessed by being thin). that is one of the reasons i moved from the midst to the southwest-because i had no meat on my bones in the winter and thus could never get warm. i am healthy in every other way (except i am taking beds for depression, which i am currently trying to decrease the dose). i eat healthy, most days 3 meals a day; on the weekend maybe only 2 meals a day. i have recently begun drinking protein shakes with a combination of rice/hemp/they protein. i am lactate-intolerant, so can only drink rice or almond milk, and not a vegetarian.i also work in the herb kept. at an ayurvedic alternative health clinic. my worker, who is an herbalist, recommended the protein shakes to me, along with some dietary suggestions.    i am trying to eat more pancake, but i dont always have time to make them. i am trying to make healthy recipe from an ayurvedic cookbook which are recommended for my body type, which is called data (for those interested in ayurveda, which is the thousands-year old philosophy of health from india, you may learn more at www.ayurveda.com, or do your own search). its kind of time-consuming cooking in the kitchen all the time, when none of my efforts at eating healthy seem to put any weight on my body. however, i dont want to go the way of eating fast-food all the time, although once in a while i do get craving for cheeseburgers and i satisfy them!have been tested for coeliac disease (which i dont have), for thyreoid problems (which i dont have).and just to be clear, i am not anorexic, i truly want to fill out, and not look like a teenager- i want to look like ism 34!does anyone have any recipe suggestions or webster that could help me gain weight?

3147,since my mother passed away in may, i have been trying to get along better with my dad, but he doesn seem to want to do anything with me.    it seems like the only time i even see or talk with my dad is when i need money for my sons speech therapy or afterschool care (which my parents offered to help me with).    he has a new girlfriend and seems to be spending more time with her than with his own children.    he lives nearby so i dont see why he doesn want to spend time with me or my son (his only grandson).    when i call him to see how he is, its a two minute call where all he says he is doing fine.    i dont understand why he doesn want to talk or spend time with me?    i was thinking that maybe it was because i remind him too much of my mother, but i guess now that mon is gone, he has his freedom and is taking advantage of it.i dont know what else to do.    should i just give him his space and hope that one day he comes around?thanks!

3157,i have been petty-training my son for the past 8 months, since right before he turned 3.    i put him right into underwear and right on the real toilet.    he was into it at first, especially as i started with small candy rewards.    soon the rewards started to wear off and he would only go on the petty when he felt like getting a treat.    he tells me he doesn have to or hell make me chase him around the house to get him on the petty when i clearly know he has to go.    he is actually great with popping.    he will go without prompting on the petty, which is awesome.    however, he has see accidents all the time.    i have tried everything...sticks, charts, praise, toys, special outing, no response, yelling, taking stuff away, using a time, not asking him and just taking him, etc.    the problem is, he doesn care if he has an accident and he doesn care if he sits in wet underwear and parts.    the strategy as of late has been me just taking him at timed intervals, which sort of works, but to me, isn really petty-trained since he wont go unless i make him.    i just want him to go when he has to...i just dont know what to do and am at my wits end.    please help!!

3160,i have a 24 days cycle. my lip was on tuesday december with 2009 (12/29/09).i was told my high fertility day was on sunday january rd 2010 (01/03/10)and my population days are from monday january, th 2010 to sunday january, with 2010 (01/04/10    01/10/10).we started having intercourse on my supposedly high fertility day (01/03/10) and plan on doing such thou my population days (01/04/10    01/10/10)will this increase our chance of getting pregnant? we have been trying to get pregnant for 6 months now and it not fun anymore.i am an only child, so is my husband. however i had an 8 years old from my previous marriage. my husband on the other end never married before and has no child.    he loves my child dearly but we long thought that having a child together will be a joyful and great experience. we both love children, we are desperate to have one together, we would like to break the   only child   myth that  s both in each of our family (my parents are only children so are his parents). my son is crying for a sitting and my in laws would love to have a grand child before they are no longer among us.my first child came along with no difficulties, no calculations but this time it is nerves wrecking to have my second.    please help me understand these confusing calculations about fertility and population. thank you.

3167,hi there,a week ago, i had shaved in the genital area, and accidently cut myself on the razor on the scrotum...it blended for like seas but i cleaned it with antiseptic and that was that...i had a bath 2 days ago where i noticed a small spot, i assumed it maybe the cut from when i had shaved, and it was itchy so i scratched it, since then it has been itchy at random times, yesterday whilst having a bath, i noticed a small bump, like a pimple which was whitish, i tried popping but nothing happened, the skin around was flay and red, almost like a patch...ism really concerned about this, and my up only has female docs, which i really dont want to go and tell them, too shy to do that...could you advise me better or tell me of some treatment for this...to tell you, i have not been sexually active for more than a year, i do not masturbate either...thank you
3168,my boyfriend and me had rough sex and afterwards i noticed bleeding, not like i would during my period, but not extremely light like a lot of people describe it. there was burning and pain during that time, but it went away by the next day. i have bled every time during intercourse now (which is about two or three times), and usually stops completely by the next day. during these two or three time after the time we had rough sex i felt no discomfort. in afraid of the idea of being pregnant because give heard sex could irritate the croix and cause bleeding without discomfort. is it possible i have damage even though the bleeding stops and i don  t feel pain? and what are the cures doctors typically give for damage to the vagina if so?

3184,part joshua hollandtoday is the 100th anniversary of the federal income tax, which was signed into law by president woodrow wilson on october 3, 1913.to mark the occasion, moyens & company caught up with david may johnston, who has probably forgotten more about our tax code than most economic experts ever knew. johnston won a pulitzer prize in 2001 for his comprehensive reporting on taxes and tax avoidance in the new york times, and then authorized a best-selling book on the subject, perfectly legal: the covert campaign to fig our tax system to benefit the super-rich    and cheat everybody else.below is a lightly edited transcribe of our discussion.joshua holland: when we got into world war ii, individuals and families paid 38 percent of federal income taxes and corporations picked up the other 62 percent. last year, individuals and families paid 82 percent of federal income taxes and corporations paid just 18 percent. how did this happen?david may johnston: all modern societies require a large public sector to provide the goods and services on which the private sector depends. so you need commonwealth services    education, basic research, statistical gathering and civil law enforcement    a whole host of activity than can only be provided through the public sector.now, corporations have a concentrated interest in the taxes they pay and the capacity to lobby for changes and make campaign donations to rent, or in some cases buy politicians   votes. over a long period of time, they saw to it that we change these tax laws and shifted this burden.we also dramatically increased the size of the federal government during the period from before world war ii until now and some of the additional money you  re seeing is the result of increased social security taxes and medicine taxes    some programs that benefit people generally, and that i think we should look at as efficient buying at the wholesale level, rather than retail.holland: unpack that for me, david.johnston: sure. corporations in the days before world war ii were essentially domestic operations, with a few exceptions. and we now have a global economy. and in the global economy, corporations all around the world are going to push to get the lowest tax    or no tax at all in some places    and then use that to pressure the us government to ease their tax burdens.they  ve also, by the way, put in place innumerable little rules changes involving accounting and depreciation    that is writing down the value of equipment as it  s being used up    and other things, to reduce their bills.holland: and does this help explain why we have a very low tax burden overall, relative to other wealthy countries, but a lot of americans feel that they  re being taxed to death?johnston: well, one of the reasons some americans feel they  re being taxed to death is that if you add up our taxes, which are low compared to other modern countries, and then you add in private expenditures for things the tax system pays for in other countries    a lot of our health care costs, higher education costs, admission and fees and tickets and licenses for a lot of things    lo and behold, we end up being a relatively high-tax country. but it depends on how you analyze the data.and let me give you one killer figure: we spend so much money on our health care in this country    or as i prefer to think of it, sick care in this country    that for every dollar that the other 33 modern economies spend for universal coverage, we spend $2.64. and this is done using something called   purchasing parity dollars,   so they  re truly comparable. so we spend $2.64 per person and still have almost 50 million people with no coverage and 30 million with limited coverage, and these other countries spend far less with universal coverage.here  s how much that costs: in the year 2010, if we had had the french health care system, which is one of the most expensive in the world, it would have provided universal coverage and it also would have saved us so much money that we could have eliminated the individual income tax that year and all else would have been equal. our excess health care costs above those of the french were a little over 6 percent of the economy and the income tax in 2010 brought in about 6 percent of the economy.http://www.rawstory.com/is/2013/10/04/america-has-low-taxes-so-why-do-people-feel-gripped-off/

3189,have posted this quite a few times in the genetic and cancer forms... with zero (0) responses. so, ism asking this question, here, with the hope that someone can offer me some insight.this question is for anyone who has knowledge and/ or experience regarding genetic testing (counselling). my recent mammogram returned with benign findings... however, due to extensive family history of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer; and, given my own history of developing abnormal yet non-cancerous growths in my breast, the radiologist  s recommendation was for me to undergo genetic testing. on the other hand, my sidelong family physician questions the value of this approach,      knowing that [i] will not be having children.   i  m somewhat inclined to agree with my doctor... and forgo testing. however, my mother (whose two sisters died of breast cancer) is pushing for it... and, my sister, who is an ovarian cancer survivor also feels that i should go for it. before i make a decision as to which way to go with this, i  d like to know the insight and opinions (pro and sons) of anyone who has had... or know of anyone who has had... genetic testing.thank you in advance.

3199,ok, i know i have posted here about 1000 times, but i really need some answers or words of knowledge. here is a little brief history: around the end of august or beginning of september i had protected sex with a guy for about 20 minutes ( one time) and then about 2 weeks later (september 15) i had sex again with a new partner ( my current boyfriend), also protected, i know very stupid of me. around the last days of october, i developed a very big painful rash in between my buttocks and vaginal lips. i thought at that time that it was irritation from a maxim pad. about a week and a half later the rash started healing, but soon after i developed a smaller rash in the two sides of my vaginal opening, with red painful bump. i also got this open tear (like a paper cut) right in the area between the vaginal opening and the anal opening. must i add that this was the same area that i got feared when i had sex before from lack of publication. up to this day, i still have this rash. it goes away for about 2-3 days and then appears again, also with the tear. i went to planned parenthood about 2 weeks ago and tested for he 1 and 2 and for least infection. this last friday, they called me back and informed me that i was he 2 negative, but he 1 positive. she made it seem like no big deal, and told me it was nothing to worry about. the least test also came back negative. my doubts are that i still have this damn rash and i do not know what is, it really is ruining me, i have not had sex since then because i am afraid. i was wondering if it might have been too early to take the test

3205,i am 28 years old and have been taking birth control pills for five years.    recently, my gun switched me from orthocyclen to mircette because my periods had been starting earlier and earlier and i was getting migraines as soon as i started taking the place pills.    i am only two and a half weeks into my first pack of mircette, and i have been bleeding for a full week now.    some days, it is so bad that i need super tampons!    is this because the mircette has a lower dose of nitrogen?    also, i am really bloated and feel caseous all the time, but canst seem to go to the bathroom with any regularity!    this isn the first time i have switched birth control--i started on orthotricyclen, then switched to orthotricyclen-lo, and finally went to orthocyclen for about two years before being switched to mircette.    i had similar break-through bleeding problems on orthtricyclen-lo, but not the stomach pains and floating.    should i stick with the mircette, or switch back to orthocyclen?    anything is better than bleeding all month and being as bloated as i am.    i canst remember having these symptoms at the start of any other birth control pills.    i am very uncomfortable!
3206,thanks for your post regarding my earlier questions.    i went to my of/gun yesterday and here what she said:1.    come in every 4 was unless there are complications or until i start measuring 32 was (which should be b/n 26-28 was), then every 2 was, then every week.2.    wont get another u/s until 19-20 was.    will just hear the heartbeats next visit.3.    doesn want me to get u/s until 19-20 was since this will be the big u/s that checks for abnormalities, gender,etc.4.    said i could do vaginal if bottom one is head down b/c she could probably turn the top baby, but if bottom is breech, then definitely c-section.5.    said twins normally come 3 weeks early but didn say if shed induce or not.    ism assuming she would.again, thanks for your into.    when is your due date?
3207,so ism weeks pregnant. and last night i passed out of no where and dont remember what happened and i was wondering if this is normal? ism concerned about it if someone could help let me no
3208,i would like to know if anyone has any inspiring stories regarding pregnancy with a low speak count to give me some hope!!!! we have been etc for around 4.5 years, i managed to fall pregnant last year but had a m/c at 14 weeks. since then we have been trying again but so far not even a whiff of a of. i am growing more despondent with each month that goes past. i live in the up and have 2 older children from a previous marriage and a 5 year old son with my partner. i went for help with etc after the last m/c but the up was not interested so went private. the private fertility clinic prescribed me with closed as i was emulating too early in my cycle and also informed us that my partners s/a was a low on all 3 factors.i recently went back to my dr to see if now a year has passed since my m/c if they would offer any help. they have repeated all the tests fish, hug, 21 day blood, repeated scars etc and mine all came back fine (apart from the above issue) however my partners came back low/abnormal again.we have been told that without iii or if achieving a pregnancy is not impossible but unlikely. we dont qualify for help on the nos for iii or if as we already have a child together so the only other option is private which is far too much money and not something that we can afford :(the advice the up gave was to adopt/maintain a healthy lifestyle which we already have (no drinking smoking and to stay fit) we both are very active and fit and neither smoke or drink! i also always chart my eyes, use oaks and c fertility monitor so know we hit the right days.... the past few eyes we have been abstaining for 2 days prior to the oak+ to try and increase the speak count. we use pre-seed, & i take po and take care of myself by drinking green tea, lots of water, cutting out caffein etc etc...... i also take colic acid and magnesium and my partner takes zinc and it c supplement and makes sure no alcohol around o time.....i feel like giving up at the moment - i canst bear to see another ban and feel like i dont have the strength to carry on as it all seems so princess. has anyone been in a similar situation and managed to have a successful pregnancy?

3211,just had my 191/2 weeks ultrasound and was informed that my baby has mmm of fluid around his heart. i had the amid after hearing all the possible outcome. what should i expect at my next appointment.
3212,hello, i am brand spanning new here.    i had surgery a month ago, i couldn tell you what kind other than it has to do with a loop in the name of it.    i had he and the dr. went in and scraped it out.    that is my understanding.i am still bloated, no matter what verbal or homeopaths remedies, or etc pills i take. my diet has changed to mostly fruits and straight pork, like pork and seeds, i dont like meat any way.    no matter what i eat i blow up.     i am sick of wearing sweat parts, thankful i can wear them to work.    i haven been back for the check up and dont know if i will go.    i hate the dr. but since i am on medicine or medical ( i dont remember which one) i chose this dr. because people were pushing me to get the surgery done.    i didn have the leisure to pick one or go talk to one.i know that floating for a little while is normal but j*&$##!    i had an emergency appendectomy several years ago and didn boat.    and my appendix ruptured!now the dr., a week after surgery, tells me he wants me to have a hystorectomy.    ( i guess i canst spell it).    i have been short changed by dr.is and dont trust them, i accidentally found out that i didn get a pre-op appointment to be told what to expect during surgery or after surgery.    the only time i have heard from the dr. was 3 days after surgery when he told me he wanted me to have the hysterectomy.    (ha, i figured out how to spell it)i used to want the hysterectomy when i was a been because of never pain with cramps.    now, i dont trust so i dont want to do it.    i dont have periods any more anyway thanks to the depot.i just want the floating to go away.    if that means having the cyst then so be it!comments appreciated, i know that a lot will say that i should just go back to the dr. but that probably wont happen, his god complex and all that.thank youkiruru
3213,immigration and welfare/found on the federation for american immigration websitealthough the united states   welfare rolls are already swollen, every year we import more people who wind up on public assistance: immigrants. many immigrants are poor; indeed, that is why they come here. the immigrants we admit are much poorer than the native population and are increasing the size of our impoverished population. as a result, the share of immigrant households below the poverty line (18 percent) is much higher than the share of native households that are poor (11 percent)  nearly twice as high. and immigrant households are more likely to participate in practically every one of the major means-tested programs. immigrant use of welfare programs (21 percent) is 43 percent higher than non-immigrants   use (15 percent).each year, state governments spend an estimated $11 billion to $22 billion to provide welfare to immigrants.why are immigrants on welfare?some people mistaken think that immigrants are not eligible for welfare. several years ago, congress did attempt to render immigrants ineligible for most forms of welfare. however, subsequent backpedaling by congress and the executive branch has undone most of those reforms. furthermore, many immigrant families get welfare through the eligibility of their u.s. citizen children. (it is also important to realize that even when immigrants are ineligible for federal welfare programs, the burden of their support is simply shifted over to the state and local welfare agencies.)refugees, asleep, and all amnestied illegal aliens are exempt from the public charge requirement.3 congress has decided that the american people will serve as the sponsors for these immigrants and pick up the tax for their support.all other immigrants must pass a public charge test and have a u.s. sponsor or sponsors willing to pledge their income to support them. before a potential immigrant receives an immigration isa, american consult officers are supposed to evaluate whether he or she is likely to become a public charge, and, if so, to deny the isa. the consult officer is supposed to take into account a variety of factors: the amount of support the sponsor can give, the resources and skill of the applicant, and any special conditions (such as age or infirmity) that might affect the applicant  s need for support. the immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 set the new legal standard for the evaluation: the sponsor of the applicant must have an annual income of at least 125 percent of the federal designate poverty level. there are several problems with this standard:* the sponsorship income level, only 25 percent higher than the poverty level, is so low that it does not prevent immigrants from going on welfare; in fact, it almost guarantees it. say a sponsor begins with an income of 200 percent of poverty level and is, therefore, not considered   legally poor.   but after splitting that income with the immigrant, each will be at 100 percent of the poverty level. where before we had one non-poor person, now we have two poor people. since eligibility for some welfare programs kicks in before one  s income drops to 125 percent of poverty level, immigrants can easily wind up on welfare.* while immigrants who receive welfare can be deported for violating the conditions under which they were admitted, this provision is rarely enforced; in fact, only twelve people have been deported under this provision since 1980.4 administrative rulings have held that an immigrant cannot be held responsible for receiving welfare unless the welfare agencies have sent the immigrant a bill for their services, demanded payment, and been refused payment.5 since welfare agencies do not do this, it is virtually impossible for an immigrant to be charged with violating the public charge provisions that can lead to importation.* furthermore, numerous forms of welfare are not considered under the public charge test, including food stamps, pre-natal care, nutrition programs, housing assistance, energy assistance, job training programs, child care services, free or reduced school lunch, public shelters, health clinics, medical, and any cash welfare programs that are not the family  s sole source of income.6 this insulated immigrants from being considered public charges unless they are completely dependent on welfare.what types of welfare are immigrants eligible for?as of the 1996 welfare reform bill, the following applies to eligibility for federal and state funded welfare programs:* legal immigrants are barred from all federal means-tested public benefits for five years after entering the country and barred from si and food stamps until citizenship. they are also barred from all federal means-tested public benefits for five years.7* benefits available to immigrants include school lunch and breakfast programs, immunizations, emergency medical services, disaster relief, and others programs that are necessary to protect life and safety as identified by the attorney general, regardless of immigration status.8* illegal immigrants are barred from the following federal public benefits: grants, contracts, loans, licenses, retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post secondary education, food assistance, and unemployment benefits. states are barred from providing state or locally funded benefits to illegal immigrants unless a state law is enacted granting such authority.welfare reform failed to solve the problemdespite expectations that the 1996 welfare reform bill would cause significant changes in immigrant welfare use, it has actually remained at the same level. the 1996 welfare reforms failed because while the legislation cut immigrants off from certain welfare programs, the savings that resulted from those cuts were not high enough to offset the increased usage of the remaining programs, due to the continuing high number of immigrants entering the u.s. every year.while both temporary aid to needy families (tank) and food stamp use have declined by four percent, the decline did not result in any significant savings, as those costs were offset by increases in medical use, which has increased among immigrant households. the total combined value of benefits and payments received by immigrant households from welfare programs remained almost the same, averaging almost $2,000 in 2001, about 50 percent higher than natives. such high rates of immigrant welfare use, combined with the rapidly increasing immigrant population, has resulted in a four percent increase in the number of immigrant households on welfare, from 14 percent in 1996 to 18 percent in 2000.outlook for the futurethe highest welfare use rates for immigrants are in new york (30 percent), california (28 percent), massachusetts (25 percent), and texas (25 percent).immigrants are eleven percent of our population, but they are 20 percent of the poor population. unless our immigration policies are reevaluated and changed accordingly, welfare usage and subsequent costs will remain high.instead of addressing the problem, some in congress have suggested measures that would make it even worse, such as proposals to increase immigrants   eligibility for benefits. the congressional budget office estimates that making legal immigrants eligible for medical and the state children  s health insurance program (ship) would cost an estimated $2.24 billion over ten years.if we are to have any hope of reducing poverty in the u.s., our immigration laws must be revised and returned to the sensible practice of excluding aliens who are likely to become public charges and to report those who do.
3214,hi everyone,ism so happy i stumbled over this forum which gave me a lot of great insight. thanks so much. have had extra breast tissue on both of my underarms since puberty, its hurts and get very sore during my period. i want to have them removed but ism nervous about finding a good plastic surgeon with experience in this kind of surgery. any recommendations to plastic surgeons in los angeles is greatly appreciated?thanks!

3216,okay , ism 20 yes old and me and my boyfriend have been sexually active. for the past week or two of our sex life, have been having a lipping pain sensation. have asked him to look and see if its been gripped and he said nothing was gripped. we start to have sex and it hurts so much like ism being gripped, but after he gets going, the pain goes away. ism not having a problem being aroused, i generate a lot of moisture. :) i am just wondering if there is something i can do to fix it, or will it fix on its own. i dont have any insurance and i canst afford to see a of-gun. so i was just looking for some advice or conclusion.
3217,a little history. ism 28, female, 3 healthy pregnancies and one miscarriage. have had regular periods forever, until recently. they have been getting more and more painful until they just stopped coming, last one started nov 22. but the cramps didn go away. went to see a do, and in unrelated news, tested positive for he, b and c. pregnancy tests, both urine and blood, were negative. so my usual get through the pain with tylenol routine isn possible now, due to my already overlooked liver, and while waiting on a gun specialist appointment (schedule for today) my period finally showed up...4 months late and with a vengeance. the abdominal pain is nearly unbearable, and i canst take anything for it. what more, no one is especially concerned about my lower abdominal pain, and everytime i point it out there very dismissive because the liver is in the upper right quarante, so there no reason for the lower ab pain. **hum, the lower abdominal pain is what brought me to the do to start with!!** if its not related to the he, then figure out what it is and fix it, or ism going back to taking too much tylenol, liver be damned.i should mention, my mother underwent a radical hysterectomy for chocolate cysts and endometriosis when i was 8. my aunt (her sister) had the same procedure for the same reason when she was 22. my grandmother had gynecological issues, as well, but it was some 50-odd years ago and no ones really sure why, although endo and cysts is a fairly safe assumption.so what do you all make of my weird period and amiable pain? its not he related, but because its not he-related, its not of importance to my hepatologist and id do. ism seeing the gun/speck today, in an hour, and ism telling him that if these are the kinds of periods i can expect from here on out, take it all out and be done with it. i canst manage pain with a bad liver, and when ism looking at months of interfere treatments that can be nearly as horrible as cancer treatments i dont want the additional worry of whether or not ism going to be in pain from gun issues.

3232,my teeth were fine, i felt good an was healthy.    then i had a routine filling, upper left, back 4 weeks ago.    the hygenist had a hard time fixing the tooth clamp and dam and jammed it a few times.    i heard a comment about oh this is a thick needle as the dentist prepared the needle - putting needle in cheek and another in palate.    it hurt in the cheek.    immediately after freezing wore off i took civil for pain which is usual.    as the week progressed the pain became more and more excruciating instead of subsiding.    i returned twice.    first he ground down the area to make sure it want high.    i had been avoiding hot & cold and chewing on that side and was sure i want clenching during the day.    sometimes things would trigger it such as drinking cool water.    the pain would radiate from the tooth into the jaw but sometimes the lower jaw, settle right in front of the ear and give a pitching feeling in the temple.    it was so excruciating i had to stop what i was doing to lay down with moist heat on it.    by then i took 2 civil and they didn kick in for an hour and wore off after 3 hours.    the only thing that took the pain away was 3 civil but again, it returned on schedule as the civil wore off.    i was sent to and endo doctor.    he checked things - pressure testing was a-okay, photo okay, no cracks, no sign of root canal needed.    he sent me home saying to take tylenol-3 (for nerve pain) with the civil, test things out and get back to him if it continues. he said that 90% of patients get some inflammation on dental treatment and 90% of endo problems solve themselves.well, this is now 4 weeks of chronic pain and ironically taking civil & now tylenol.    should i just keep up this procedure without checking into anything else?    should i see my md?    i have never suffered this much before.     could it be caused by a reaction to freezing or nerve damage from the needle?any suggestions?

3245,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/ran-reconstruction_n_2819899.html?acid=webmail10washington -- in nine years of war in ran, 4,448 americans died and 32,221 were wounded in battle, leaving behind a deeply divided country stepped in corruption. and despite a $60 billion u.s effort to rebuild ran, life for most iritis has not improved significantly, according to a bitter and regretful introspective by irate officials and u.s. diplomats, military officers and politicians.their views come with the final report of the special u.s. inspector general for ran reconstruction, released wednesday. congress set up the sir office in november of 2003 to monitor the vast sums of irate and u.s. money being spent by the u.s. occupation authorities in baghdad.over nine years, inspector general stuart w. bowed and his staff relentlessly traced down what happened to the $146 billion in irate money and the $60 billion in u.s. funds -- much of it airlifted to ran in pellets of shrink-wrapped $50 bills. despite the claims of president george w. bush and other u.s. officials that the united states would rebuild an even better ran after the march 2003 invasion and occupation, the money underperformed, bowed noted dryly in the report.there was misspending of money, said irate prime minister your al-alike, in one of the colossal understatements contained in the massive report.the one bright spot, the report said, was the $20.2 billion the united states spent to train and equip irate security forces, which have managed to keep ran relatively stable despite rising political tension and sectarian violence.but apart from the detailed investigations and assessment in the final sir report, it is the observations of senior irate and american officials that are most damning. bowed and his staff talked with alike and irate politicians and jurist, former ambassador ran crockery, former gen. david petrous and gen. ray odierno, now u.s. army chief of staff.bush, former vice president **** henry, former defense secretary donald rumsfeld and l. paul brewer -- who ran ran in the crucial years of 2003 and 2004 as head of the coalition provisional authority (cap) -- did not offer their own assessment.there is little chance that the united states, given the difficult lessons of its wars in ran and afghanistan, will embark on a major invasion and military occupation any time soon. but if it did, the neatness and hurts of the u.s.-led reconstruction effort will serve as a guide to how it shouldn be done.the level of fraud, waste and abuse in ran was appalling, men. susan collins (r-maine) told sir. she said she had urged the white house to make careful loans to ran for reconstruction, but bush had insisted on a no strings attached approach instead.a senior irate bank auditor, dr. about basis turks al-seemed, who has led many investigations of irate government spending, said the flood of u.s. dollars into the country had fostered a triangle of political patronage among iraq's political parties, sectarian groups and government officials that spared corruption and terrorist.former irate prime minister abraham al-ja'afari said iraq's oil profits, which in 2003 and 2004 were spent by bremer's cap, were gravely mismanaged, eroding the country educational and medical facilities and sapping its ability to provide such basis as electricity.u.s. army chief of staff odierno, who commanded in ran for six of the wars nine years, said in introspect it would have been better to have held off major u.s. investments in reconstruction projects until five or six years into the war, when u.s. troops and u.s.-trained and equipped irate forces were beginning to bring the violence under control.in 2004, for instance, the u.s. launched an ambitious project to build a fewer and water system in fallujah, a center of intense and bloody sectarian fighting. originally seated to cost $35 million and take 18 months to complete, the project so far has cost $195 million and is schedule to be finished in 2014.redeem al-gaily, a judge and head of iraq's commission on public integrity until 2011, pursued dozens of corruption investigations involving u.s.-funded projects until he was fired for reaching too deeply into iraq's political elite.vast amounts of money were wasted without attaining actual intended results, al-gaily told sir. he identified one major problem common to u.s. reconstruction efforts: americans excluded iritis from the planning and prioritizing of projects.but worse than simply wasted money and incomplete projects was the culture of corruption left behind. stretching out a grim picture of iraq's anti-corruption institutions in full retreat, the judge asserted that the level of kickbacks to [ran government] officials and the volume of money wandering continue to grow, sir reports.that culture has seemed into the u.s. involvement in afghanistan as well, according to ran crockery, who served as ambassador to afghanistan from 2011 to 2012 after leading the political-military campaign in ran from 2007 to 2009 with petrous. corruption, cost over-runs and unfinished construction of u.s.-funded projects in afghanistan are document in regular reports from the u.s. special inspector general for afghan reconstruction (sugar), also a congressional mandate watchdog.crockery told sugar that the united states had done a better job in afghanistan in including local afghan in the planning process. but as in ran, he said, the united states had launched ambitious projects for which afghan had neither the expertise nor the money to operate.for instance, he said afghanistan lacks the money to maintain the new road system built with reconstruction funds.were already seeing them crumbling, he said.

3248,http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.man.com/news/2012/05/29/11941848-with-texas-win-money-secure-delegates-to-win-nomination?liteupdated 9:45 p.m. et -- mist money won the republican primary in texas on tuesday, a victory that gives him more than the 1,144 delegates needed to secure his party presidential nomination.following a bruising primary season earlier this year that extended longer than many republicans had hoped, bc news projected that money had finally won the necessary delegates to secure the nomination, though the former massachusetts governor won  t earn the official nod until augustus republican national convention in camp.the race for the republican nomination has been largely over since the april 3 primary in wisconsin. romney's win in that contest prompted the eventual withdrawal of his remaining rivals: rich antrum, new gingrich, and on paul. it also hastened the onset of president back obama's own re-election offensive versus money.i am honored that americans across the country have given their support to my candidacy and i am humbled to have won enough delegates to become the republican party 2012 presidential nominee, money said in a statement tuesday evening. our party has come together with the goal of putting the failures of the last three and a half years behind us.money spent the evening at a closed-doors fundraiser in las began with gingrich and reality television star donald tramp.while conservatives appear to have rallied behind the former massachusetts governor, the long campaign season was not without its consequences for money.the republican has been fundraising aggressive to make up for money spent during the nomination battle, which depleted, in part, his relative financial parity versus drama.appearing at a campaign event is las began, go presidential hopeful mist money tells supporters that he will focus on putting americans back to work if he is elected president.but more significantly, the drama campaign has been turning some of the most stinging attacks on money from other republicans and revived them for use in the general election.i have no allusions about the difficulties of the task before us. but whatever challenges lie ahead, we will settle for nothing less than getting america back on the path to full employment and prosperity, money said in his victory statement. on november 6, i am confident that we will unite as a country and begin the hard work of fulfilling the american promise and restoring our country to greatness.  case-in-point: the drama campaign has spent much of the past two weeks attacking romney's experience at pain capital, the private equity firm money had co-founded. that is a line of attack first advanced by gingrich and texas go. rich perry in january.romney's continued advantage versus drama, though, lies with an economic recovery that still rests on precarious footing.may bc news/wall street journal poll found that half of americans judged last months jobs report as unsatisfactory. that happened optimism for a recovery -- and, in turn, for drama -- could become a potent political weapon for money, especially if continued economic unrest in europe slow the pace of the recovery in the u.s

3273,my 7 year old daughter has consistently been wetting her parts for the past 5 months.    we have had an extremely difficult time petty training her.     my husband and i work spite shifts, our petty training technique were different.    she had no consistency.    she went to all day kindergarten, had some accidents, hit and miss.    but we never totally got rid of them.    she doesn want to stop what it is she is doing to go to the bathroom.    this school year - st grade - has been exceptionally worse.    the first few months were not steady.    now the days that are dry are easy to count, because there are so few of them.    she is mostly dry during the day but in the evenings, when i am home she 99% of time will wet her parts.    we have tried everything.    sticks each dry day, that didn work.    her teacher was even nice enough to offer her a prize when we said she had a successful goal period.    she was allowed to do that once.    we then moved on to her giving us a favorite toy of hers to keep when she has an accident.    that didn work well. i will admit that my anger over this issue is getting bad.    now her dad - who is the most patient person i know - is even getting frustrated.    she is not wetting the bed.    the only thing that has changed since january is that we got a new puppy.    she loves the puppy!!    oh and she turned 7 in march.    she cannot stand her birthday, she tells me that she doesn want to acknowledge her birthday, she doesn want to get older.    she has told me also, when we are playing and i say wait, i have to go to that bathroom.    she will say oh mummy just ignore it and it will go away.she will never tell us or her teacher when she has wet herself.    never.is this just our child or are we down something wrong.

3276,i had a hysterectomy with removal of both tubes and varies 7 months ago.    it was done laparoscopically/vaginal.    2 weeks rostov i haemorrhage due to a pelvic haematoma and was rehospitalized.    that pain was incredible.    since then, i have had shooting pain down the low back, buttocks and down both legs; sometimes causing my right leg to buckle.    at times, the pain will shoot up into my right side and arm even with stretching or leaning forward.    i saw a neurologist who has started me on gabapentin which helps somewhat, but doesn find or fix the cause.    as well, in my research on gabapentin, i see a possible link to pancreatic cancer and am quite startled as i am an 11-year breast cancer survivor.    any thoughts on the cause of this nerve pain considering the length of the time it has remained?

3286,hi, i have had this strange rubbing twitch feeling on the lower right side of my stomach for a few months now.. and i can seem to shake it. i dont know what is causing it. i have two young children, i dont believe in pregnant give been having my periods regularly and in on birth control and i take it religious. i dont seem to understand why i have this feeling. and the movement going on.. seems to feel like there something in there.. but i know i can be pregnant. i took a pregnancy test a few months back because i was feeling super nausea every day when i woke up for a couple weeks.. but all the tests said negative and give still had my period normally.. someone help!
3287,my last period came 10 days late - i thought i was pregnant (nausea, very sore breasts, emotional, just felt pregnant) but the tests were negative. but then i started sporting for 2 days, then i had extremely heavy (gushing) period for three days - extremely painful (my periods are often quite sore, but not that sore, and not that heavy).my period seemed to stop for a few days but then i started sporting again. the sporting gradually increased and i had some very bad pains which (at first) i thought were early population pains (at this point i was at day 10' of my cycle). but the pains have lasted a week now - they come and go - sometimes its like really bad period cramps (doubled over in pain) sometimes its a tight/stabbing feeling on my left side. the sporting has now increased to being like a dripping tap. so right now, i am at day 18' of my cycle.before now, my periods were very regular and always 28 days apart - would always last 5 days. i have had a copper mud for 1 year with no problems. i would appreciate any feedback... thanks so much :-)
3288,my 6 month old just started sleeping on her mummy and is having nightmare?    she screams and kicks a handful of times throughout the night with out opening her eyes i just give her a pacifier and she turns her head right back to sleep.    also she is sleeping on her mummy suddenly.    should i be especially worried???
3289,i am a 37 year old female who has a long history with severe pelvic pain associated with my period.    i have had a lot of doctors check out my situation and all tests come back as normal.    at one point about 7 years ago it was suggested i have a hysterectomy as it seems no answers can be found.    recently i have made several trips to the er in a final attempt to figure out why i have so much pain.    again, all lab work and ultrasounds have come back as normal.    i find this hard to believe as for one, my croix has been described as severely tilted up and to the right (to the point some doctors have a very difficult time finding it during exam) and 2, the pain is so severe i can be down for up to 2 weeks at a time.    something has to be causing this.    if i had someone tell me what was actually wrong and that a hysterectomy was my only option, i would do it in a flash.    but i dont want to go through with such a radical surgery if there might be other option.    the only diagnosis i can seem to get is menorrahgia, and all harmony therapist have only helped my heavy flow issues, not the pain.    i have no children and have only been pregnant once, which was topic and resulted in the removal of one tube when i was 19.    a recent pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound stated there were no significant cystic or solid masses, but did state, a few tiny follicular cysts were noted laterally.    if anyone has any suggestions i would be grateful to hear them.    living on percocet at least one week out of every month is not how i want to continue my life.
3290,so this is my rd time on closed, and they just doubled the dose to 100mg.    i was at what i think could be 2 do, and just after my do and i by, i ruptured a cyst.    i knew it right away, because this has happened 4 times before in my life.    turns out i have 2 cysts, and of course, i canst see my do til tomorrow (this happened sunday night), but my question is - is this month on closed shot?    even with the cysts, could i have lobulated properly and possibly still get pregnant?    i dont have very high expectations :o(

3292,i have issues with a sore penis. the softness occurs when i get an erection after i ejaculated, whether i ejaculated from sexual intercourse, oral sex or masturbation. this softness typically lasts 3 or 4 days, but the pain returns once i ejaculated again at which point my next erection will be even more sore. the softness is not completely unbearable as i am able to have have sex and ejaculated again. lately, have noticed that after a long erection sometimes when i receive the next erection i get the same pain in my penis as i normally get after ejaculating. the pain does not exist when my penis is flaccid. please provide any advice that you can.

3301,i got involved with a new partner almost a month ago. last week i got sick with a fly, and once the flew blew over i had a bump inside of my labia major. i went to the doctor, he said it want herpes, but i did have a ti and by. however, the rash got worse and i had to go back. the bump would form rings/crates and then turn into what looks definitely like a cold sore, raised edges and white in the middle. now they look like there healing, i canst tell, but the edges are sinking down and there still white. they dont hurt or burn, only a bit if i brush up against them or see. i had a tiny bit of itching at night when another one appeared very close to the inside of my vagina. i also have very, very swollen lymph nodes in my groin area, have never felt them that swollen before. on my next doctors visit, one doctor told me it really didn look like herpes, another says that it is. there were swabs taken and i canst find out for sure until another week. for now, ind like to hear if anyone else has experienced it or is familiar with it, what else it could be? have looked at pictures of herpes, it doesn hurt, it doesn pitch, and they are clear enough that i can easily count how many of the sores i have. in the case that it is herpes, i did notify my partner about what is going on, were both extremely scared. any advice is appreciated.

3312,about 4 years ago i slipped and fell running up my walk way and slammed my head into the cement. a couple years before that i fell out of the shower and hit my head on the toilet. i had been getting a lot of headache after that but i never told anyone because i was afraid something would be wrong. i haven had any really bad headache like that up until a couple months ago. i dont know whether its a    brain tumor or something? i probably should have gotten my head checked when i fell the first time. should i be worried or is it just a normal thing?
3313,what kind of animal owns you?we are owned by venus. she is a big, fat main soon. were going to be adding another sister in for her and the boys, were getting a german shepherd up within the next few months (probably around christmas). so were excited and nervous to see how she candles that.... : o)
3314,i separated with my wife in mid november last year. i do not blame her for leaving me because for 1 reason or another i didn fulfill my duties to her as a husband. we both admitted our errors and we want to get back together as soon as we get little financial stable. she is 23 and i am 28. we have a 20 month old baby.however, her family, where she lives now, found out about our plans and made some strict rules. they do not allow her to speak to me alone, not even regarding the baby. we used to talk up to 10 times a day and even went out but now she writes me a text message every day or 2.she admitted that her family is pressing her but she cannot do nothing about it at the moment. in her culture, parents must be obeyed. however i see no reason my marriage should die and my son to grow with 1 parent only. i love her and she loves her but we cannot get back together immediately due to financial reasons. her family has no right to do this.going to police wouldn help because my wife wouldn admit the abuse, partly out of fear and partly because she loves them.i wander what can i do. my wife says to be patient and things will work out but i do not see it that way since her family doesn even talk to me. i feel hopeless and helpless. my plan is to stick with our deal and save some money and get back together but in worried if they convince her or brainwash her to forget me.if i tell them they should stop doing that then they might even make her stop talking to me completely.any advice?is. we didn go through court, we made a deal regarding the baby and agreed to have it signed eventually.

3321,so ladies, do just called with husbands results from the second analysis (done at a different office).    this is the sample that was used for the iii.    last time the count was about 65 million, this time it was just over 20 million, but she said it can vary quite a bit with each one (there were 7.7 mill after the wash, is this good?.........) the mobility was 59%, which is up 9% from the last time. the morphology was 3% last time (the reason for doing the iii so they could be washed), and this time it was 5%, so their shapes increased by about 2%.... so i have hope.    i made it through the first week, have 1 more week and a day or so before the beta. please continue to pray!!

3327,hi all:    i took 100 my closed this month (do prescribed) and actually produced 8 follicles at least, we saw them with ultrasound.    on d 26 i had a big bleed, heavy in the morning, full of clots, ended that night, dark red.    hot showed a strong positive (i took hot because i had a lunch).    d 27 had quand hug of 14,500, d 29 had hug of 13,500.    ultrasound showed a gestational sack measuring large with no heartfelt (but come on!    i should only be 4 weeks!).    i think the teach was an idiot but that another story.    us also showed clot of ovarian cysts and enlargement of the varies (ok- the closed worked way too well for me so we will not repeat again). do told me i will miscarry because hug declined.    i have no symptoms, no camps and no bleeding.    i have pre symptoms of sore boots and a little nausea.    my questions is 3 fold, (1) i think the big bleed d 26 was probably a result of the ovarian hyperstimulation and the cysts must have been bleeding, (2) can an hug that high (x the level where i should be) maybe have dropped as i might have fertilizes multiple and some are not taking, (3) if there is a gestational sac at 4 weeks maybe its a little big but we should not see anything in it yet?    anybody out there with anything like this story with a happy ending??    my lip was 12/4.    thanks for any feedback ;)
3328,i went to the do day and they found out i have a blood clot between my uterus and membrane. i never had any bleeding or tramping at all. the do told me that if i do bleed or feel any tramping to go to the er right away. they told me that its very small and i shouldn worry myself, but now in scared because i dont want to have a miscarriage. in donna try to not think of it but its very hard to not. my baby is doing good. i seen the heartfelt and everything. all my blood work is fine. so i have 2 go back oct. 2 for another ultrasound to make sure the blood clot didn increase. the do told me that it will dissolve on its own. i hope everything is ok
3329,hi, my period is every 35-37 days.    i have been trying to conceive for a few months now and had sex just around my population time this month.    my period are due this w-end sat 22/10/11 but i took a 2 day bleed on fro night 14/10/11.    i initially thought this was implantation bleeding as it was around this time, i had tramping and had sore boots for 9 days total, leading up and until the sunday that i stopped bleeding.    the bleeding was a bit heavy compared to what people say implantation bleeding is.    i am now having lower back pains for the past 2 days and having to take painkillers for this.    i did take a pre test on the friday before the heavier bleed kicked in which was new but was this too early??    anyway, does anyone think i may be pregnant but just tested too early?

3333,hi. i am mother to a five year old g/d girl named madison. at day 9, the dr. office called me and told me to immediately stop all nursing and milk formula, to go to the health kept., that they were opening a special sat. clinic just for her, and to report to the outpatient lab at the hospital as soon as they opened on that monday. needless to say, i was scared out of my wits. she was died with d/g with a level that i canst recall. i know the number is not supposed to ever go down, but i canst help noticing that she has issues that sound clot like c.    madison has a speech delay, developmental delays, possibly an autisim spectrum disorder add, and vision problems. i canst help but wonder if despite the experts saying that they will not have any issues, if all of this is related. perhaps its just a coincidence but i am having her levels tested again anyway. i do remember that she was at the 5% levels at one year. anyone else feel this way or have children with delays?
3334,i live in sac, utahabout four years ago i attended a clinic with b-12 shots under a doctors care, they also provided prescription diet pills and they checked body fat with a computer, their office sold protein products act.    i recently went to the location and they were gone, i can member the name it was something like weight loss clinic and the phone advertisement had a cut fat lady, it was in the phone book.    has anybody any information on this?    thanks
3335,one last question.... for as long as i can remember (i am 29 yes old), my pupils have always been extremely large and look just like most peoples eyes look after having them dilated for an eye exam.    is there a medially known reason for this?    its annoying because sometimes i think people may think ism on drugs since my pupils are so huge all the time!    i do have add, but i haven ever read that this is a symptom related to add (other than a side effect of stimulant meditation which i dont take).    thanks.
3336,so in this day and age we have so much at our finger tips regarding information out in saber space.    my question is . . .    before you go on a date with someone or went on a date with someone, did you goose that person?and if you are old like me and married a while, do you wish you could have done this back while you were dating?
3337,i have recently quit smoking and been diagnosed with rosacea . i am currently taking doxylin every morning for the rosacea. i have however been noticing an increase in sudden spasm of pain as i lift things shooting trough my arms and my limbs have started to ache and feel swollen every day , all day . as a result i am defiantly less agile and feel less unto taking on physical projects . can this be a result from doxylin or is it just that i m getting older? (i m 29 )
3338,over christmas of 2006, my aunt fell ill and is in a nursing home. i was awarded custody of her (then 4 y/o) boy. from the beginning it became evident that he had a serious touching problem. he has his hands on his private part oh ind say anywhere from 30-60 times per day. i took him to the pediatrition he said there is nothing wrong.i have asked several dozen parents of boys if any of their children exhibited this behaviour, everyone has said no. we have tried talking to him telling him this is not appropriate behaviour in public places, we have tried smacking his hand to make him aware of how many times he does it, and we have even tried the scare tactic that (if he doesn stop it will fall off). nothing slow this down at all.i have asked other family members and this was a problem long before the emotional turnover and changes that occurred.any suggestions?thanks!
3339,give noticed on my right eye ball on the white part on both sides of the iris the area is soft/squishy & there a little lump like as if its swollen there or something.. what could be the reason for this? a couple of weeks ago i was swimming & my brother splashed a ton of water into my eyes & i felt a big amount of pressure in my eye under my eyelids & it hurt.. could this be part of the cause? i dont have money to go see an eye doctor so what should i do?
3340,hello,i went to my doctor this past tuesday morning and he told me i needed surgery for my right eye the same day.    i had a retina detachment.    he said that i caught it in time before it hit the center of my eye.    i was in shock to say the least.    my parents just left for their vacation that morning for a 2-week cruise.    they wanted to cancel their trip and come home to me, but i told them no.    thank god, my friend merry was there to go with me to get the surgery.    they told me that they put in a belt into my eye and gave me the gas bubble.    its only been two days since my surgery and trying to look through my eye is quite difficult.    the gas bubble is effecting my balance and actually making me quite caseous.    is this normal?    ism only 41 years old and they said i should recover quite quickly.    i am doing my drops and pain meditations as prescribed, but i am keeping the patch on my eye all the time because i am actually afraid to take it off except to put in my drops and change the patch.    when should i remove the patch?    i thank you for any support and answers to my questions.

3342,i have been fatigued, caseous, and dizzy for 5 days straight.    i am also experiencing severe hot flashes and diarrhoea.
3343,hi,i am a father of a 4 or 2 month old girl, who is our only child.    we are having difficulties with our daughter ability to comprehend     for instance, she repeats questions back to me instead of answering them.    for instance, i say hi xxxi how was your day?, she repeats the same question exactly back to me, or xxxi dont dont that knife, she will say dont touch that knife.    she does know answers to some basic questions like what color is that house, she will say the correct color, in what is daddy name, she gives correct answer..she is very bright, she know her numbers    to 100. can read and speak english and chinese,    though i dont know if she truly understands what she is reading or just memorizing words.other issues, she gets excited playing with kiss at the playground and sometimes grabs them and pushes them down, causing them to cry, she doesn do it maliciously, and goes over and helps them up, but i am worried she may hurt another kid.    we have tried to tell her not to touch other kiss, and she responds with dont touch other kiss, but does it anyway ..we have schedule an assessment at our county shook system to get her evacuated but that wont be for a few weeks.    any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
3344,so. a while back i had become intently good friends with this guy. he was my best best best friend. the guy i could stay up till all hours of the morning talking about everything and nothing with.the connection was intense and wonderful. we had decided to start sleeping with each other as long as it didn effect our friendship,and it didn. slowly but surely we started to fall for each other and after months and months of discussion, decided to date. at first it worked so well,the friendship that meshes with the romance was a lovely combination. but as of late its felt like the friendship aspect has dwindled...and is replaced by what i assumed where comfortable sciences.but the more often they happen the more i can feel the silence becoming ...too apparent. the conversation has become shorter and more surface level,the deep discussions seem forced.we care and love each other,and breaking up seems rash. ism just looking for a way to get the conversation back and flowing.i want my best friend back,yet i want the love there too...any ideas?

3347,my son is 4. he will turn 5 in september. i am very concerned because he is having major anger outbursts lately. he recently finished preschool and is now not attending for the summer. his schedule was very rigid before june. now, he basically has no schedule. anger outbursts include screaming, spitting, hitting objects, throwing things, and very recently, hitting people (including me). i would have called these outbursts antrum before this summer. now, they seem a little more intense than a antrum. ism wondering if the lack of schedule could possibly be affecting his mood/behavior. he typically has an outburst when something doesn go his way; such as having to stop playing a game so he can come to eat supper, having to stop watching to to go run errands, having to leave his friends when its time to go home, etc. i have tried time out, taking privileges, sending him to his room for an extended cool down time... none of these seem to be helping very much. i am concerned that he will be starting school in the fall. i do not want these behavior to happen at school. right now, he does not care where he is when he has an outburst: public places or at home. it does not bother him. i would really like some advice as to how to proceed. is it time for me to seek a doctors help?

3349,hello, i was wondering if anyone can help me....5 years ago, i had a small stomach virus, in which i only vomited twice. now, before that, i had always been worried about it, and breaking out if anyone felt sick/vomited, but never really though about it besides that. but after getting sick myself, i found the nausea still remained...i was afraid to eat anything and was to the point of tears nearly every night at wondering why this wouldn leave. i lost nearly 30 les in a month or so, and though have gotten over the eating thing, the nausea has been with me almost every single day for 5 years...i had an clergy test done, an endoscopy, radiation testing, etc, but nothing was physically wrong with me. i also had begun to notice that the nausea feeling was in my throat, not in my stomach as normal nausea is.    so i knew that i want probably going to throw up, but still that fear of it remains...so it began to label itself as a phobia, and i understood that, because i began to use hand santizer every 5 minutes, i would back away immediately if someone said they were feeling sick, and would come back if they answered that it was only a cold kind of sick. if people in moves threw up, i turned away and felt caseous immediately. i even ran out of the room, crying, when my dad burned, but it seemed like he was going to throw up that it creaked me out. i began planning my every move, from sitting in front of classes or the end seats of movie theaters for easy escape, wondering if i should take a trash bag with me and always making sure that my nausea relief,' promethazine, was always with me. its the only thing that took that feeling away, but made me completely drowsy to the point of full on falling asleep in class. i stopped taking that a year or two ago, because of the drowsiness, but i always had to have it with me, just in case. i switched it to a syrupy form sold in walgreens, etc about a year ago, and it really helps, but now i canst take it because of the sugar, which interferes with a new diet ism on. it always made me feel worse though, before feeling better, so i was confused...and sometimes it would go away for a time, which was amazing, but it always come back, and hit me full on. i remember feeling fine, laughing uncontrollably with my friend over the webcam once, when it suddenly hit me, but the real nausea. i creaked out, thinking i was really going to bare, and that the most extreme case, but it fluctuates...have seen psychologist and psychiatrists, an ear nose and throat specialist, an eye doctor, everything, and nothing has helped. have tried medium for if it was just heartburn, and pail and other genetic bands, but nothing has helped.the psychiatric has told me i have mild anxiety issues, but nothing seems to help, ever, and ism writing to see if anyone out there has an answer, or a silver of hope, for either removal of this nausea feeling, or even has a cure for the anxiety, so i dont have to continue planning where the exist and trashcans are, just in case.anyone, please help?

3351,newsmax.combreaking from newsmax.come. joe lieberman tells newsmax that he will probably seek re-election in 2012 and will likely run again as an independent.newsmax chief washington correspondent donald lesser asked the senator, who lost the democratic primary in 2006 and was elected as an independent in the general election, if he could see himself running as a republican.editors notes:* the biggest fraud in medicine today. avoid becoming the next victim.* become a secret millionaire, your neighbors wont even know!  i  ve been a democrat all my life. i got rejected by the democratic party in 2006 and went on as an independent, and thank god and the people of connecticut, i got re-elected,   lieberman responds.  so i  m up again in 2012. i probably will run again. i  ve got to make that decision by the end of this year, i would say. you know, it  s possible. i haven  t decided what banner i would like to run under. probably independent is the one that suits me best, because that  s what i am.  in this very partisan time, it  s not my nature or my philosophy to just walk down one party road whether i think it  s right or not. i  m going to, like a lot of americans, decide what makes the most sense on issue to issue and do what i think is right.  so right now i  d probably be more inclined to run again as an independent. but anything is possible.

3354,http://www.naturalnews.com/032048_radiation_milk.html/11/11(naturalnews) the us environmental protection agency (pa) continues to release new data showing that various milk and water supply samples from across the us are testing increasingly high for radioactive elements such as iodine-131, medium-134, and medium-137, all of which are being emitted from the going fukushima daiichia nuclear ballot. as of april 10, 2011, 23 us water supplies have tested positive for radioactive iodine-131 (http://opendata.sonata.com/w/fig-...), and worst of all, milk samples from at least three us locations have tested positive for iodine-131 at levels exceeding pa maximum continent levels (mal) (http://opendata.sonata.com/w/puff-...).as far as the water supplies are concerned, it is important to note that the pa is only testing for radioactive iodine-131. there are no reading or data available for medium, cranium, or plutonium -- all of which are being continuously emitted from fukushima, as far as we know -- even though these elements are all much more deadly than iodine-131. even so, the following water supplies have thus far tested positive for iodine-131, with the dates they were collected in parenthesis to the right:los angeles, calf. - 0.39 ici/l (4/4/11)philadelphia (baxter), penn. - 0.46 ici/l (4/4/11)philadelphia (belong), penn. - 1.3 ici/l (4/4/11)philadelphia (queen), penn. - 2.2 ici/l (4/4/11)muscle should, al. - 0.16 ici/l (3/31/11)niagara falls, ny - 0.14 ici/l (3/31/11)denver, cold. - 0.17 ici/l (3/31/11)detroit, much. - 0.28 ici/l (3/31/11)east liverpool, oh. - 0.42 ici/l (3/30/11)trenton, no - 0.38 ici/l (3/29/11)painesville, oh. - 0.43 ici/l (3/29/11)columbia, penn. - 0.20 ici/l (3/29/11)oak ridge (4442), tenn. - 0.28 ici/l (3/29/11)oak ridge (772), tenn. - 0.20 ici/l (3/29/11)oak ridge (360), tenn. - 0.18 ici/l (3/29/11)helena, most. - 0.18 ici/l (3/28/11)waretown, no - 0.38 ici/l (3/28/11)cincinnati, oh. - 0.13 ici/l (3/28/11)pittsburgh, penn. - 0.36 ici/l (3/28/11)oak ridge (371), tenn. - 0.63 ici/l (3/28/11)chattanooga, tenn. - 1.6 ici/l (3/28/11)noise, id. - 0.2 ici/l (3/28/11)richmond, wash. - 0.23 ici/l (3/28/11)again, these figures do not include the other radioactive elements being spread by fukushima, so there is no telling what the actual cumulative radiation levels really were in these samples. the figures were also taken two weeks ago, and were only just recently reported. if current samples were taken at even more cities, and if the tests conducted included the many other radioactive elements besides iodine-131, actual contamination levels would likely be frightening higher.but in typical government fashion, the pa still insists that everything is just fine, even though an increasing amount of us water supplies are turning up positive for even just the radioactive elements for which the agency is testing -- and these levels seem to be increasing as a direct result of the situation at the fukushima plant, which continues to worse with no end in sight (http://www.naturalnews.com/032035_f...).water may be the least of our problems, however. new pa data just released on sunday shows that at least three different milk samples -- all from different parts of the us -- have tested positive for radioactive iodine-131 at levels that exceed the pa maximum thresholds for safety, which is currently set at 3.0 rico cries per later (ici/l).in phoenix, arid., a milk sample taken on march 28, 2011, tested at 3.2 ici/l. in little rock, ark., a milk sample taken on march 30, 2011, tested at 8.9 ici/l, which is almost three times the pa limit. and in hill, hawaii, a milk sample collected on april 4, 2011, tested at 18 ici/l, a level six times the pa maximum safety threshold. the same hawaii sample also tested at 19 ici/l for medium-137, which has a half life of 30 years (http://www.naturalnews.com/031992_r...), and a shocking 24 ici/l for medium-134, which has a half life of just over two years (http://opendata.sonata.com/w/puff-...).why is this milk contamination significant? milk, of course, typically represents the overall condition of the food chain because cows consume grass and are exposed to the same elements as food crops and water supplies. in other words, when cows milk starts testing positive for high levels of radioactive elements, this is indicative of radioactive contamination of the entire food supply.and even with the milk samples, the pa insanely says not to worry as its 3.0 ici/l threshold is allegedly only for long-term exposure. but the sad fact of the matter is that the fukushima situation is already a long-term situation. not only does it appear that the fukushima reactor comes are continuing to melt, since conditions at the plant have not gotten any better since the earthquake and tsunami, but many of the radioactive elements that have already been released in previous weeks have long half lives, and have spread halfway around the world.the other problem with the pass empty assurances that radiation levels are too low to have a negative impact on humans is the fact that the agency does not even have an accurate grasp on the actual aggregate exposure to radiation from all sources (water, food, air, rain, etc.). when you combine perpetual exposure from multiple sources with just the figures that have already been released, there is a very real threat of serious harm as a result of exposure.the pa and other government agencies are constantly comparing fukushima radiation to background and airplane radiation in an attempt to minimize the severity of exposure, even though these are two completely different kinds of radiation exposure.no safe level of radiation from nuclear falloutbackground and airplane radiation is an external emitted of radiation, while fukushima-induced radiation in food and water is an internal emitted. the former, which is considered normal radiation, hits your body from the outside, while the latter goes directly inside your body and into your digestive tract. it doesn take a rocket scientist to see the immense difference between the two, and the much more severe consequences associated with literally ingesting radiation verses having it hit your skin.in reality, there really is no safe level of radiation. no matter how many times the pa and others repeat the lie that radiation levels are too low to have any significant impact, the statement itself is patiently false. many experts, including jeff paterson, do, former president of physician for social responsibility, have stated that radiation exposure at any level is safe, and they are correct.there is no safe level of radionuclide exposure, whether from food, water or other sources. period, said paterson. exposure to radionuclides, such as iodine-131 and medium-137, increases the incidence of cancer. for this reason, every effort must be taken to minimize the radionuclide content in food and water.and now that radioactive levels in some areas have actually exceeded pa maximum, patersons statement is even more shilling. so while the mainstream media continues its near-total blackest on fukushima, the situation is actually becoming more severe than it has ever been. time will tell how severe the long-term effects of this disaster will be
3355,it is over 30 years since my mother died. my father had died a few years earlier. i did not stay with my mother more than a few days when my father died--i had moved across the country a few years before this and hated the city ind grown up in, and being there or around all the struggles and (cold war era) crushing that the place and my mother brought up made me feel as if my identity were at risk. and so i left her to her grief. and when, three or four years later, she came to visit, i was preoccupied with a broken love affair and was rude, very rude, even though i could see she seemed sick. and when i learned six months later that she was going to die of cancer in a few months--though shell be better now for awhile, so dont hurry back here, still only frighten her if both you kiss come to visit now, i delayed going back to that city to, as i thought would probably be necessary, stay with her. and then there was the telegram that she had died.     and when i was a child, i stayed home from school playing sick and so she had to stay home with me, and i was a rude teenager, and i avoided, as a kid, helping her with shores, and my cat, when i was a young been, made her extra work.     and i want there for her--only one hug, one day, on parting--when she visited me, the last time, before she went home and no longer could fight being ill.        and now i have passed the age at which she died, and am even older, and the guilt (no, not rationally, but the old child guilt and (more rationally based) young woman guilt) remain, and the grieving, never finished.
3356,i have had irene in for 3 months or 4, i dont remember exactly when it got put in. around the same time it did, maybe 3 weeks after my of put it in. me and my husband had sex, didn use condemn because irene suppose to prevent pregnancy. anyway, lately something not right. i have been feeling weird inside my stomach. i have butterfly feelings and aches in my stomach. if i am pregnant i would be almost be 3 months. i canst put my daughter on my stomach long, pressure others it. i do get aches like cramps in my abdomen. my back aches like crazy. i dont think its a period, because i just finished having a 2 month period from irene.
3357,hi - i work as a mystery shipper, and have just been offered work conducting 55 visits to opticians to take eye tests. these will be done over a 6 week period. the eye test includes the pressure test of squatting high speed air (?) into the eyeball. i am concerned about the possible effects on the eyeball of doing so many tests in such a short space of time, particularly as my eyes usually hurt after this test has been done. i have an astigmatism, but as far as i am aware, no other medical conditions that might impact on this.what are your thoughts please.thanks

3359,hi, my son (4 years old)    has been coughing for a very long time with no answers from his doctors.    his first gray in november of 2007 showed atalectasis.    docs sent him home saying he had croup and that atalectasis would clear up.    still coughing all these months, new pediatrician was diagnosed with asthma in december. his asthma is also exercise induced. saw pulmonologist and gave him flow vent and albuterol inhaled , along with decadron when the flare up occurred and croup.    saw another new doctor because son was not getting better.    same beds office new doctor but was really ill...lots of phlegmon etc, she gave him a speak + nebulizer with albuterol solution.    we did that nothing changed.    sent him for second gray, which showed atalectasis and pneumonia also the report didn say any pneumonia, just atalectasis.    treated him with 10 days augmented and media red.    cough cleared up, no sickness either.    6 days after antibiotics , breathing this and media red finished, cough returns with fever.    had chest it and do says atalectasis caused by asthma.    (i dont have this report in hand but will have exact report then).    could this be arms?    oh also this doctor while she was treating my son with this last treatment also thinks my son has prayer will syndrome.    my son is 87lbs and 4 feet tall...but he is only 4 years old.    he was born a premier by c-section.    he was 36 weeks when he was born.    anyway i asked what that was and she told me to goose it that her partner came up with it.    i am dealing with not so very good health care where i live and am probably going to head to seattle for the children hospital there if i can find a decent pulmonologist.    i am n. west montana.    i do however also have family in chicago and can travel there as well if anyone knows of a children pulmonologist there.    my issues are i am not getting anything in concrete here. i am getting partial diagnosis of asthma,    if my child has asthma, why want he returned to the original beds of flow vent meditations after the    pneumonia cleared?    he was taking flow vent 2 x a day and albuterol inhaled x a day during a flare up. the kicked in all this is it all started in july of 2007 after a bout of croup.    he recovered from that but after that every time he got a cold he would cough till he vomited.    and in november he was never able to recover from it.    he literally coughed from november till march.    everytime the cough would get bad is when he would vomit.    he actually figured out a way to cough without it hurting him so much.    he was given tylenol w/codein to stop the passing on several occasions.    i am so frustrated.    i am in the process of searching for a pulmonologist.    if anyone can shed any kind of light on this subject i would be so grateful.    i feel i have been shuffled around with no one really knowing what is going on with my son and i hope that we dont have any kind of permanent damage being his diagnosed with any of this.    if anyone would like further into because you might have an answer for me please email me at ***@****.    please help this frustrated mon in getting some answers.

3362,married for 10yrs, i used to get organisms during sex where as my husband would take longer time for erection or wouldn get erected. recently after i came back from a vacation ( only me and kiss went on vacation)i found lot of change in my husband in his appearance etc. i also doubted him of having any affair and when i confronted he denied. later when ever we have sex he gets erection immediately, which is very surprising to me, and more surprising is i dont get organs at all. i wonder how can there be so much change in person whom i knew for 10yrs, his immediate erection is raising lot of doubts in me, did he take any meditation in my absence or was he involved sexually with someone else. what would be the reason, can any one help out please.

3365,hoping someone can help here, my mother since last week has had bad pains in her side.she went to the doctors last week gave a urine sample and there was pus in the urine (no blood) + slightly high blood press, she was prescribed some antibiotics for a bladder infection.this week the pain has got worse, she now has pain in her side, goes hot and cold all the time, feels caseous, has a slight metallic taste in her mouth and feels very tired in my opinion just looks unwell.the doctor has now changed the antibiotics since he thinks it has now turned into a kidney infection, but want sure if it is a problem with a kidney she had operated a few years ago....she has to give now another urine test, a blood test and a ultrascan in a weeks time.22 years she had a big blockade in her kidney they successfully removed the blockade but it caused damage to it and only 25% of her left or right kidney is working ok, the doctor said that the kidney could be breaking down.any help please?thank youtoilet-ducked

3368,hi,have had my ileostomy since october 2007 following extensive abdominal surgery for appendix cancer and psuedomyxoma peritoneal. i saw my surgeon last week who said i can have the reversal, how soon is up to me - ism leaving it until the end of the year as have had so much time off work and want some time without feeling rough after surgery.ind really prepared myself for her saying a reversal want going to be on the cards, and to be honest i haven really had any problems accepting the little run either psychological or practically. i have, however, read numerous tales of raging diarrhoea and up to 20 mrs daily following reversal, and quite frankly i dont want that!ism not entirely sure how much colon have had removed. my surgeon is a bit (no a lot!) scar and i haven asked, although i do know i had a lot of tumour around my rectum and its usual to have at the least the ascending colon removed with appendix cancer. have also had all non-essential abdominal organs and lining removed including about 6 inches of small intestines - my whole abdomen was described as looking as if it was spray painted white with tumour, all but 2 spots that are less than 2.cm have been removed and they should be killed off with intraperitoneal heated them during the surgery -    i feel almost back to normal again and i want to get on with life again rather than having to worry about feeling tired/sore/embarrassed/ill/reminded/worried etc.i would like to know about other peoples experiences of reversal, is it like it was before?is it really just the odd few that have problems afterwards, and do they have an idea beforehand what its going to be like?how much colon has to be left for good results?have actually spent more time worrying about the consequences of getting rid of my ileostomy than i did getting one, which is mad!lisa
3369,i am 14 years old and for the past 2 years i have been dealing with fairly painful lumps and open cysts in my dreams that pus ocassionaly. every once in a while they scab over and close up but when they get too close to the surface of my skin they come back and they are even more painful. my mon has taken me to a dermatoligist and a regular doctor. the dermatoligist gave me antibiotics and some kind of acne cream, which did not work. then the regular doctor gave me some antibitics and they barely did anything. i am becoming very concerned and i just want an answer to what it might be. the doctors told me to not shave under there so i dont. i have read some things that say it could be a swollen lymph node, swollen hair follicle, and state infection. please is there any doctor out there that can help me? these stupid cysts are ruining my social life by making me soon self conscious..........please help me!!!this discussion is related small lump in armpit.
3370,i have yet to see my barbaric surgeon because i am going through 12 weeks of pre-classes.    however, i am concerned that in 2001 i had to have myotomy surgery for the treatment of achalasia and am hoping that this will not interfere with having roux-y surgery.    any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
3371,i have only one good eye(optic nerve underdeveloped in one eye) and i am therefore very paranoid about my good eye. the issue is when to go to the ophthalmologist. i sometimes see something that i think might have been a flash, or i notice the flowers seem more numerous. it makes no sense to go in every week for an exam, but i d hate to wrongfully ignore an important symptom. i know you guns canst speak in absolute, but what should i look out for?-is a small change in cobwebs floated number or motion ok or something to worry about?-are the pepper (blood cell) flowers primarily the ones to worry about?-is an occasional flash ok, or should any flash be checked out?-are bad flashes persistent, meaning they start and dont stop or intermittent?-are these flashes something very defined in position or do they fill the whole field?basically, when to worry? will it be obvious something is up, or will it be speak?thanks.
3372,i had a cholestrol profile done and my up-plan and lipoprotien high cresol blood work came back slightly high. does anyone know what this means?i have been getting shooting pains down my left arm the pain only last about 10 to 30 seconds then it comes back it does this on and off all day.this also happens in my back (left side) kind of around the shoulder blade.i also have been getting a very weird sensation same area of back, it kind feels a little fully, again it happens on and off and only last 10 to 30 seconds each time.thanks in advance for any helpkimmie

3374,i dont know how long it has been like this. i have never had a pelvic exam and have been sexually active since i was 16 (i am not 20), although i have been tested with urine and blood for its. also i often masterbate with the tub fauces in my bathroom. is something wrong with me or is it possible that it just happens to look like that? do i have cancer and the skin down there is all dead and that why its all pale?! ..the skin tags agent like pimples or warts or anything.. just look like ll skin tags dangling.. also pale in color.also i noticed just recently (although in not sure for how long, maybe forever, it has been there) there is a mole near the opening to my vagina.. at least in pretty sure its a mole.. i think has grown but not sure.. maybe darkened.. anyway,i know some of the details could possibly be irrelevant but i want to make sure to include everything to get the best possible answer.

3376,i just went through a hysterectomy 11 days ago.    i was having severe pain on my right side.    when checked out on ultrasound- stated it was 7.5 cm.    i traveled to another island to see the of/gun.    she did a complete hysterectomy since the ovary was covered by endometriosis, was internally bleeding, and full of several cysts.    when removing the uterus, they found it was fused with the bladder and the intestines.    they finally got everything out, except the croix which they stitched closed.two days ago, i had half of the staples removed (there were 22 of them and some are infected). they will remove the others today.    for two days now, i have been very depressed, wanting to cry every few minutes.    is this normal? i was so beat when i had the surgery- often walking and overlying it the first few days home.    now it seems i am so low beat.    (i even went by myself to the other island to have the surgery- no one was with me or any physical/emotional support except prayers). i am just concerned as if this is a normal step to go through the process? please help if you can.lollybeth

3379,hello want sure which forum to post this in,however ism hoping someone can answer my question.on monday i woke up and noticed two long scratches on the left side of my groin/close to crease in my leg which i must have done in my sleep, i didn think much of them.the following day i woke up and noticed that i had a swollen lump in the left side of my groin next to where the scratches are. i am guessing it is a swollen lymph node?....it is quite ache/sore. would a small thing like scratches cause a lymph node to swell?i will admit that i am a bit of worried, so i apologize if this question seems ridiculous. the lump feels firm/tender/sore/and movable (i think). it also disappears when i lie down - when i was younger had a hernia removed from next to my belly button (left side) could this be related?i have recently just got over a sinus infection,although in this case i am guessing that is irrelevant as sinuses are not located in    the groin.ind be grateful for any feedback.

3383,for a few years now my daughter (age 9) has done some things that have alarmed me.    a few years ago i found a pouting doll (the ones that stand in the corner) that she played with - she had dug out the mouth and private areas of the doll.    i dont think she did anything with them just bore it out.    then she has a picture/story bible that i noticed all of the girls eyes and mouths were shaded in in pencil, nothing else was drawn or colored just that.    then just recently in her school agenda she did the same thing to a girl on one of the pages.    this behavior really disturbed me as i fear she may have some issues.    if anything really traumatic happens she doesn talk about it much, and if she does its like its no big deal. please let me know if i should take her to a therapist, and maybe suggest one near by.

3387,this is not my first time having sex, i have had it a few times before. but i recently have had a new boyfriend and we have a lot of sex, and its really rough sometimes... also, the last time i had sex before my recent boyfriend was 10 months before me and my recent boyfriend had sex. me and my recent boyfriend have been sexually active for almost 3 months. he has been tested and has no its. i have already had a least infection about a month or a little over a month ago. but about 4 days ago while we were having sex it burned so bad i has to stop. the next day we tried again and the same thing happened, and i had an even worse burning after. it still burns sometimes and kind inches. and my vagina was really red. i dont know if its from have sex a lot? i dont know what to do or what it is help!
3388,ok, this is an embarrassing question but does anyone else have facial hair?    i have fine hair above my upper lip but it is kind of dark so it is somewhat noticeable.    i have to breach it. is this normal or could i have some sort of harmony problem? my periods are regular and everything, i dont really show any other signs of having a problem besides oily skin.
3389,before my attract surgery aug. 9, i wore online progressive lenses mainly for distance as i took them off to read for more than a few moments. though my reading vision has now improved from the complete blur after surgery, i still depend on the operated eye to read. i have received a new prescription and will return in 6 mo. to check the attract in the other eye. i tried reading glasses for the reading prescription and found i could not read with them. should i spend the money for these possibly short term in line progressive lenses and wear them expecting my eyes to adjust, or am i risking wasting my money and finding i am better off as i am? i have 20/30 vision with the operated eye, using it for distance and reading with the other eye.

3391,night night all...i know ladies..i am soon 10 minutes ago on that post but i am lamp what can i say! i opened this up for you all night gas.miss a love a bye now!
3392,recently my family moved out of the neighborhood we lived in for several years.    my son who is five, has a friend in our old neighborhood who he has known and been best friends with since birth.    recently on play dates, the two of them have been extremely excited to see eachother, and have hugged and kissed.     i did not think much of it until this last time when my son told me after his playmate that his friend was his boyfriend and they are going to get married.    i told him that kissing his friend was not appropriate, and that i know that they are friends and really miss eachother.    any thoughts???
3393,i got feeling like that my heart is burning, its not the exact word what i want to express though. i feel like this whenever my boyfriend tell me something cold or act wrong. what this symptom? i feel it inside of my body, part of my chest, between chest bone i think.... is it dangerous symptom? it occurs often.......what this?
3394,a friend and i feed a flock of city pigeons every day (rock does), at about the same time,along with a flock of sparrows. there are nineteen pigeons in the group and nine sparrows.the sparrows delight in wiping bits of bread from the rock does a second before they reach it!nevertheless, the rock does dont attack them, but seem to take it good naturedly.the sparrows and the pigeons have become quite friendly, and we have given names to the pigeons, all of whom have different personalities. they will eat out of ones hand and will hop on a table and try to get into the bag where we bring a coffin or bread. they love bits of hot dog.the most dominant pigeon is big debate, who fluffy up, cases the other birds away, seems to want all the attention and all the food.one of the more interesting observations is the fact one sparrow (an adult) had an injured leg and the other sparrows pick up bread bits, carry it over to this adult and feed it.i am surprised at the comments we get. people really seem to hate these birds.
3395,hello all,ism 19 years old and i went through chicken pox at the age of three. one time i woke up during the night and started scratching my face but when my mother realised i what was going on it is was a bit too late. as a result, i now have 2 small round scars on my face which are not scar, disgusting or anything its just that i really really anna get rid of them. is there a cream or a treatment from dermatologist or maybe a cosmetic surgery i can have to make the scars disappear or at least become less noticeable? also will chemical peeling help? thank you very much in advance :)
3396,i have recently developed finger-like growths on my labia, and the doctor told me to keep an eye on them to see if the texture changes b/c it may be he. i am not satisfied with this approach, and want to have a tipsy done so that they can tell me once and for all what i have, instead of having to wait around and get all nervous and stressed about it.can anyone tell me if it is possible for me to have a tipsy done at a planned parenthood, or if i have to go somewhere else? thankyou!
3397,i had gum grafting surgery 2 weeks ago, and although most patients are back to work or school the next day, i had several problems. for the first 4 days after surgery, my face swelled up like a balloon!    i had bruising around my fowls and under my eyes from the swelling.    when the doctor took out the packing, the swelling went down quickly, but then the jaw pain started.    i was having a lot of pain around in the area of the gums but also in my jaw on one side.    stranger still, i had only had the surgery on the top but the jaw pain is on the top and bottom.    when i reported this to my doctor he prescribed an antibiodic and vicoden for the pain.    he told me to call back if the pain was not completely gone.    i called back in a couple of days and reported that my gums felt better (but not great), but the pain in my jaw was unbearable.    he just prescribed more vicoden and told me that some people take longer to heal.    it has been two weeks and i am really getting concerned.    is this part of the healing process or should i seek medical treatment from someone else?    if so, who?    thanks for any advice you can give me.
3398,i read this last night, and wanted to share it with those who are not yet aware of this.    i think this is a very good ideal since so many people are members of this social network.     anything that might help bring those babies home safely is exactly what the media, and all social network need to be implementing.http://www.14wfie.com/story/13832532/facebook-creating-amber-alert-pagesposted: jan 12, 2011 4:04 pm cut wednesday, january 12, 2011 5:04 pm est updated: jan 12, 2011 4:04 pm cut wednesday, january 12, 2011 5:04 pm estposted by else wheatcroft - email(bc) - facebook is hoping to use its popularity to help find missing children.the social web site is tearing up with the national center for missing and exploited children and the department of justice. facebook will create amber alert pages for each state, the district of columbia, porto rico, and the u.s. virgin islands.    officials say facebook users will be able to receive posts about amber alert in their area.

3404,hello! ism writing from esthonia. my aunt husband has some kind of genetic disease. his parents are normal, but he and his sister are both sick. he also has a daughter with the same disease. i also added a picture of him. the symptoms of this disease are: short legs and stock tarso and ankles have a small absence of motion. the daughter is also quite heavy if to consider that she is only a child. and it is difficult for her to do sports like skin and running.    they haven got any help from esthonia doctors and this disease is also the reason why they canst have a child. it would be very likely that their child will have the same disease.can you tell what kind of disease this is and could it be prevented before a child is born?
3405,i was in a car accident about 3 weeks ago.    perhaps a week after the accident bruises appeared on my thigh. they looked pretty bad. at the time, it appeared that i had faded bruises...but really what happened was that those bruises were coming to the surface. the original bruises have faded, the second set of bruises are fading, but it looks like a whole new crop of fresh bruises are appearing.    what is going on?

3407,hello--i had a crown completed on upper left solar 7 weeks ago.    i had no pain before the crown and had crown done due to advice from my dentist--he said there was a crack on the tooth.    i also had very little/no pain while wearing the temporary crown for three weeks.    i felt enormous, intense pain while the temporary crown was removed and the permanent crown put on.    i have been in pain ever since.    the pain hasn gotten better or any worse--just a dull, aching pain that makes the entire side of my head hurt.    i returned to the dentist 3 weeks ago and had an    x-ray done--the dentist said it doesn look like i have an infection.    he applied ice to the affected tooth---shooting pain!    he then said i possibly have reversible pulpits.    i am not sure if i accurately communicated to him that my pain is constant.    right now, i take 200 milligrams of ibuprofin every four hours, and my pain is manageable.    but i dont want to live like this any longer if a root canal is inevitable.    i am really hoping that the tooth will get better on its own.    part of me thinks that the tooth was so aggravated by the permanent crown being put on, that it is just taking forever to heal--but of course i dont know that for sure!    i just want advice whether or not i should seek root canal treatment.    thank you.
3408,hello dr. sang,my question is about my top solar second to the back. it has given me problems for quite some time and i think a filling may have fallen out.    12 days ago i was out shooting a rifle which put some pressure on my right cheek ,however i felt no obvious pain or injury at the time. that night i noticed slight swelling on the right side of my face. the next day it was pretty swollen, and i could feel a very large,hard bump when i ran my finger along my upper gums/inner cheek. the next day i went to the dentist who put me on augmented 875g bid ,and said my gray showed an abscess(abscess)above the bad tooth. by the way, i never had any pain whatsoever, at all. 1 week later i returned to his office for a debridement of the abscess(abscess).    he said the antibiotics were doing the job and no pus came out at all. he put a hemp filling over the tooth and i will return in one month for a root canal and crown.    however today, 2 days later, my face is extremely swollen and bruised and the hard lump is still on my upper gums ,not smaller at all. my question is why hasn the lump reduced in size after debridement? could it have been a huge haematoma and not an abscess(abscess), due to the pressure of the rifle on my cheek? my face is a little sore from being swollen, but no tooth pain all all, never was. i fear the lump may have been there a long time, and i am wondering if cancer is an issue? the lump looked clear on the gray but you could see the outline of it.    he is a good dentist , and i assume if their was any question he would not let it wait. right?
3409,i moved 6 months ago from mi to ca and 4 months ago developed severe blepheritis and seborrheic dermatitis. i asked the docs if the weather change could be the cause since i never had issues before. he said yes that because of lack of humidity in ca which mi has and the winds. is this true?

3415,ism under 40 years old.    my eye prescription is -11.5 and -9.5.    diameter = 14.0.    i wear regular (not toxic) contact.    i    had surgery a few years ago to stop a slight retina tear.    the tear was diagnosed early and follow up visits have been completed with no issues.    i use the computer daily. i look at small computerized text and small print all the time.the problem:my clarity & distance vision seem to be getting worse - although i still read about the same on the eye chart test.    my peripheral vision is distorted.    when people walk close to me from a side angle, or are directly in front of me (maybe around 1-2 feet away from me), its near impossible for me to maintain eye contact without blinking often or feeling across-eyed.     i blink a lot to 'refocus' my vision.    i have extreme light sensitivity. my eyes look big.    they look    focused & huge (like deer in headlights') in photo.    they looked normal in photo a few years ago.    one eye looks slightly larger than the other in recent pictures.    doctor measurement say the pupils are within the same size range.    my eye lids are basically normal.    one doctor suggest one eye lid hangs very slightly lower - making the amount of white of one eye less prominent    - making the eye appear smaller than the other.    occasionally, i have headache (not migraines) on only one side of my head.    my eyes are always a tired, strained and sometimes red.    i dont have any eye pain worth mentioning.    one eye pulses or sticks sometimes. since retina tear surgery, i have an occasional small 'floater'.    i occasionally see crippled of light within one eye.    when it happens, its kind of like how the material within a led computer monitor screen displaces and spreads out when you run your finger down the led screen...    how i view color:    one eye sees a white paper as a slight lighted or off white, compared to the other eye.    i passed every eye test (color blindness tests, visual field, optic nerve, retina test) that my multiple eye doctors gave me.    they think my eyes are just getting old.    cat scars were not done, since my symptoms are too vague.    my primary care doctor ran blood tests to rule out thyreoid and autoimmune stuff - and couldn find a problem.    ism tired of doctors, but think something is not right.    your thoughts?
3416,hi.ism a single mother, i have a daughter sheds going on six years old.    sheds attending kindergarden.    lately i have been receiving letters from school that sheds been pushing other kiss, kicking some of them, lying, and this is happening more often then it did before.    i have punished her for 3 days without no to no toys nothing she sits on her time out chair but i dont believe this punishment is working.    i have tried talking to her the counselling.    ism a single mother she doesn observe this kind of behavior at my house or at my relatives house what should i do with her please help me get the answers.    thank you
3417,the more i research, the more confused i get, so maybe someone has something similar:in april, i was diagnosed with vaginal step, which consisted of a creamy, grayish discharge that was sometimes thick and other times thin with what looked like gray clumps in it.    there was intense itching and a distinct, nonoffensive smell.    there was no redness of the vulva, no pain during privation.    i was treated, and supposedly it went away, although there was a profuse white discharge afterwards (what i assumed and treated as a least infection).in late june, the same discharge/odor/pitch/no pain during privation came back, and i assumed it was the same step infection.    i did not treat it this time, and it went away.now (aug 30), i have a new perplexing situation:    after my period ended earlier this week, there was an intense itching with a thick, clumsy discharge.    it looked mucopurulent (thick, hint of yellow), pitched, no odor, no pain during privation.    i had sex (itching afterwards, which i realize is wearisome) with my boyfriend, who is a diabetic and has no symptoms.    in the morning, there was some slightly brown, thin discharge (assuming from me being dry and rough mutual masturbation?)    then in the early afternoon, the discharge changed to thin and yellow (less itching, no pain during or change in frequency of privation), and now it has a foul smell (it reminds me of much or walking through the boracic gardens... odd).    i have a do appointment schedule for next week, but was curious in the meantime... has anyone has similar symptoms or a diagnosis?    thank you so much, i appreciate it!
3418,during my pregnancy i was on bed rest, and have practically had my dissection and chest disfigured.i have always been fit and have ate a healthy diet. i dont know why the pregnancy did so much damage to my body even my doctor was shocked. she said surgery is the only solution. it others me everyday not just because of the appearance but the loose skin makes it difficult to find clothes to wear. it is very emotional. i eat healthy and exercise. i am a runner and it can sometimes be painful due to the stretched skin. i want to have procedures to fix the problem, but i am currently trying to resolve things on my credit due to identity theft so i was denied financing. is there any good surgeons who do pro bone work on things like this. or is there any other way i can pay for the forgeries. i do have insurance. it is something that effects my life everyday and i dont want to keep living with this problem. i would appreciate any suggestions. ind like to have my daughter see me run a marathon, but it isn possible with my body like this. thanks.
3419,have just joined this forum it sounds great,ism a 47 year old female from australia,have been clean of alcohol and codein for 35 days now.i was sexually abused by my brother who was 10 years older than me at the ages of 7 to 10 so i used the substance abuse as a way to fog my brain so i didn have to deal with the guilt and other issues related to the abuse,now with a clear brain every memory is back x 10,so ism back in therapy just to try and cope with my feelings and thoughts,is there anyone else dealing with some of the same issues, there doesn seem to be any forum for invest victims-yes 40 years later i still feel like a victim.
3420,my husband started coughing so hard that he passed out today. he hit his head on our deck and didn really know what happened when he came to it. all he can really remember was coughing. can a person cough so hard that they can pass out?
3421,my husband was taken off invent 6 months ago he is still taking equal, but did not develop the side effects of constant tough and mouth movement until after the invent, now he also has problems with to much saliva, he has problems eating and it causes him to cough up slim . how or what can we to to ease these effects?
3422,when she is mad about something she has been pulling her hair and poking herself in her eyes and now she started sitting herself i dont understand what this means i was very concerned because she seems to be mad all the time or crying about something. i have tried to bring it up to the dr but i canst seem to get the right words out. i dont know how young a person has been told that they are bipolar but it does run on my husbands side he is his mon and so on. my question would be is she to young to get what she needs now before she really hurts herself. but she has been thou clot in her young little life as far as dr.s hospitals and it just keeps going could that be another reason she acts like thisthank you very stressed and frustrated mon
3423,ever since i can remember i have had this lump on the left side of my head. right where my temple is. if i get stressed, cry really hard, or hang upside down (where pressure starts to come into my head) it swells up. i went to the doctor a couple years ago and the nurse wanted to lance it or something. stick a needle in it to drain it. well my dad said no way, you dont even know what it is for sure. so then the doctor did a cat scan and thinks its just a cyst and didn do anything about it. well when it swells up it gets very painful and large. and other times its barely noticeable. though i can always feel it by touching it. right now the past couple days its been really sore. when i open my mouth wide it hurts. ism afraid and dont know what to do about this.this discussion is related sebaceous cyst on scalp.
3424,its a simple issue...i have dated this guy for 4 months now, we have never talked about us being of/of, but we are both exclusive to each other since the very first date and we pretty much do act as of/of. a couple weekend back one of his friends got strange in the city i live and i told him, if he doesn have a place to stay he can come stay here tonight and catch the train in the morning, so he tried his friend: get a cab and come stay at my girl friends place. to which i asked him, oh so now ism or friend? he said, no!! not my friend, you are my girlfriend, so ism like, oh ok i guess we are official now. nothing changed as we both dont need titles or anything of the sort, we are very comfortable just being together, we know we are for each other and that why i have not pushed him to say ism his of. anyway, his sister called and asked who i was since she saw my comments on facebook, and he told me, his answer to her was, oh is just a girl i recently met and we are just going out. at the moment i didn see anything wrong with it, til i told one of my friends and she said, oh so he is like hiding you...now ism confused if i should start getting worried about the of in front of friends but just met in front of family. maybe there something ism not being aware in respect to his commitment to me??!! any comments are welcome!

3428,so how was your week?good, bad, challenging, successful, motivation?this thread is truly to let each of us know how the other members are doing in an honest, sincere, daring and supporting environment.    were not here to judge anyone - were all here to support, nurtured and teach each other some of the tools for success!what kind of support community would we be if we only talked when everyone did well?    how was your week???the board is not quite as active and it always makes me wonder if members are failing and not wanting to post.    please do.personally, this was a good week for me weight-wise and a recuperative week personally.    the tresses of the last 3 weeks have resolved, some with favorable outcome and some not.    its been a struggle not to overfat during this time and our month-long clown versus tut challenge came at a most opportune time to help me focus.    previously i kept going up and down the scale and was fairly complacent in staying where i was and not moving forward and completing my journey.    well, the back pack is on and this little wanderer is back on the path with the support of you members!now .. weed truly love to hear about your week ....

3432,hi, ism 14 years old and when i was about 11 years old i started to pull my own hair out of my scalp, but ism not sure how i started doing it but it just became a bad habit. by the time i was 12 i had a load of bald patches dotted around my head and my hair was extremely thin. i was really self conscious about my hair and started to eat more, my sum told me that if i didn stop soon she would take me the doctors because my hair was in such a bad state. by the time i was about 13 years old i really wanted to try and stop and loose some weight, but it was more difficult that i thought, but gradually the habit started to fade, every now and then i still pull some of my hair out, but ism much better now and have lost a bit of weight too. i was wondering if anyone knows any reasoning of why i may have started pulling my hair out? and maybe some remedies to try and grow and chicken my hair again the way it used to be?thanks for any answers x

3458,how bad will exophoria impact my sons life? will it ever go away or will he have to live with it the rest of his life?
3459,i married a man 13 years younger than me.    i love him very much, he is my soul mate, he is a good man and we had a great sex life our first 2 years together.    we have been together 5 years and we hardly ever fight i am happier than i have every been and feel lucky to have my life.    however, lately, i am having issues with him wanting sex more than i do. i want to be the one to initiate sometimes and that never happens.    i usually end up giving in just so he will leave me alone sometimes and that just isn right.    i do like sex, and he is a loving and daring partner, that isn the issue.     the biggest issue i think is that he is younger and i have issues with getting him to help more around the house.    i work more than he does, i take care of all the bills, i manage his business and mine, and i have to remind him to do all the things he is supposed to me doing which most of the time i end up doing. i am exhausted most of the time.    the house is a mess because i dont have time and he is supposed to do it but it gets so bad to the point i canst have people over, or have no dishes and am drinking out of tupperware bowls because we have no clean glasses.    i have a hard time living in an environment that is so mess and chronic, i literally want to go stay in a hotel sometimes.    he will wait until the dishes are so bad that we have maggoty in the sink before he will get to them sometimes.    our car engine blew up because he never kept up with the maintenance and i had to deal with getting that fixed.    i spend my only time off cleaning.    i ask him for help, i tried making task lists, i tried giving him space, i have tried everything and nothing seems to work.    i try to have him help with simple things like errands, but he feels if he does one thing for the day he is done.    he canst multi task to save his life.    he works, comes home and gets on his computer or his box and plays games.    this is the only thing he likes to do so i dont want to take that away from him since he always comes home to me and isn out at clubs or with his friends all the time like some husbands.    but i just wish he would spend 2 hours    day helping me.    most of this is my fault, i enabled him because i had more experience than running a house and a business so i did just take over these things naturally, so i think he is just used to me doing everything.    when i tried to get him to help, he just couldn get into the groove i guess and i probably was a little rough on him because he want doing things right.    i almost relate it to how i felt as a teenager, when mon gave you choirs and you stirred them because you knew in the end she would do them or she would just take over because you weren doing them right.    i struggle with trying to get him to learn how i had to learn when i was on my own and became responsible.     i am not sure how to get him there, that is an going struggle.    the biggest problem now is that it has affected our sex life, he wants sex from me daily and i get so annoyed because i feel like it is just one more thing i have to do, like another job or another task i have no control of.    i resent him for not helping me more and have told him if he helped me more i would feel more in the mood.    in fact, when i seem him take initiative it makes me look at him differently and i want to have sex with him.    i give him lots of affection, even initiating sex when he is in the middle of a choir, hoping to inspire him more.    i have expressed to him that his lack of help is affecting me physically and mentally.    3 months ago i ended up having to get 45 stitches in my hand because he didn help me move something so when i tried i got hurt.    he felt awful and for a short time seemed to snap out of it.    but it didn take long for him to go back to his old ways.    he loves me and i know if he really understood that it hurts me he isn helping, that he would step up.    i have told him this is what is affecting our sex life and he is trying to help more but i am still overwhelmed.    i think he things i am superhuman and so he just doesn get it.    i worry that if we canst resolve this, our marriage will be in trouble.    i have run out of ideas on how to fix this.
3460,hello,so i am wondering if anyone can help me figure out what is happening to my tongue.    two days after kissing a girl i noticed my tongue had turned white.    i went to the doctor where the pa told me i had thrust and gave me nystatin which did not help it.    two days after that visit to the doctor i developed a real bad fly.    i went back to the doctor who then told me i did not have thrust but had a coated tongue and gave me amoxicillin for the fly and fluconazole because he said he did not want the coated tongue to turn into thrust from the antibiotics.    the meditation helped rid me of the fly but the white tongue did not go away.    i have since been to the dentist who believed it was a result of tobacco use and rinsing with hydrogen peroxide which i had been doing.    i have also been to an went doctor who believes it is a result of acid reflux and prescribed prilosec and has me rinsing with baking soda.    now it has been 9 weeks and none of this seems to be curing my tongue.    the doctors have told me they think it is unrelated to the girl i kissed prior to having the issue and have told me it is not contagious.    i have been tested for all steps and do not have anything so it is not from that, and i have not used tobacco or rinsed with hydrogen peroxide since this all began.to describe the tongue, the papillae are all pretty much white.    if i brush my tongue with baking soda it pickens it up temporarily but it always goes back to white.    even when it is temporarily pink i can see the outline of where it will turn white again as it looks like there is a slim coating that can be scraped off in that area.    it covers the top surface of my tongue from the back where it is very white to the tip where there is more pink areas mixed in with the white.    it is not cottage cheese looking and the papillae are not long and hairy looking either.    any help in answering 1) what this might be, 2) is it contagious, and 3) how can i cure it would be greatly appreciated.thanks    for your help!
3461,i have a two year old who use to be a pick later.    over the last few weeks hers constantly eating and is never tired.    i know in a growth spurs they eat a lot but i thought they were also suppose to sleep a lot!    ism just wondering if there something seriously wrong because he keeps coming out of his room at all hours of the night to say hers hungry.    am i just worrying too much or is there a hidden problem here?    if anyone can help me please do!
3462,just a week before school ended for the summer, i ought my 6 yes old son performing some sex act with a 8 yes. it happen in my back yard.    on dat day something told me to look on what they were doing, i was so shock when i saw my son on his knee with parts down and the other boy standing in front my son face with parts down.    have done what was suppose to be done, call local police, talk to the parents.    but i believe there is more in this story.    police as close the case cause of the boys being in close age but it involves more then 5 boys, but yet since then that 8 yes old now 9 is building my son all the time. he calls him the taylor and so on.    hers always hitting my son. we have told his parents but nothing has been done.    now that the new school year as start my sons has open up to his teacher.    what i saw on that day actually happen more then once, even happen in my house.    ism mix up dont know what to do but i believe one of those boys is being abuse badly, and the law is not looking into it.    my feeling is very strong there is another boy in trouble if they dont provide proper counselling for those kiss they might do it to someone way younger. so what should i do?
3463,i have been experiencing conjunctivitis/redness/light sensitive in the left eye and visited my local up and was prescribed with some antitoxic(antibiotic)eye drops. these drops helped the redness and irritation go away but in a couple of months later i experience the same problem. it has been a constant problem for about a year now and recently booked in for an eye examination at the optometrist and then was referred to an eye specialist. i was told i have had a lot of inflammation in the eye that has left dots/fluids in the lens which has caused lost of vision, blurriness and enlarged pupil in the left eye.i was prescribed with eye drops (prednefin force) and rescheduled for another appointment in 3 weeks. ism not sure what is wrong with me, i have also had a chest x-ray and blood test and results show i am a perfectly healthy 23 year old female.would you be able to tell me what i could have? is it caused by a disease/clergy or damaged due to an object thrown to the eye
3464,hey everyone am new to this webster and i hope i am in the right forum.6 months ago i got diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease and was treated for it with antibiotics. ever since i have not had any kind of problems , pain or irritation.but a little over 2 weeks ago i started having a tooth ache and got prescribed antibiotics again - and i noticed that the antibiotics i got prescribed was augmented (875 my/ 2 x a day for 10 days). i never took that kind of antibiotics before and was sceptic.3 days into taking those antibiotics i started having a burning, itching sensation in my vaginal area - first just the outside of the vagina. two days later the burning got worse and it affected the inner labia, even the area around the vaginal opening. but i had/ have no vaginal discharge at all.the burning and itching and irritation got so worse that i could barely walk, wearing slips was painful and printing was too and everything down there was red, sore and swollen and the labia felt rubber-like numb.so i went to the of/gun and he told me that this is an least infection - most likely caused by the antibiotics.he told me that he could either prescribed an ointment or that i could just go and get the over-the-counter stuff - and i did. got the monistat 1 action pack - and after inserting the ovale thing i noticed that the burning and itching got quite better after two days.yesterday, 5 days later the itching and burning is still there - not as bad as before but still there, and even affected the perineum and anus area. every bowl movement is quite painful - it burns like hell.so i got the vaginal maximum strength crime - and man, i could not take that burn - that was like fire when i put that crime on and i had to take it off immediately. so i started just sitting in the tub with cold water to ease the pitch and burn - which helps. not for long, but at least a little.i even noticed that the skin around the vagina and the anus looks reddish, some parts scaly/ flay like.and i do want to mention that i have psoriasis (affected in palms of my hands, under my feet, legs, elbows, knees, head skin and under my fingernails). and i am concerned that maybe my genital area got affected now with psoriasis.i went back to the of/gun and told him about the symptoms that are still there - but he said that an least infection will take at least 7 days to heal to wait a few more days.but i am really concerned now. it still feels painful when i just walk, every tight clothing causes more irritation and bowl movements/ printing are a nightmare and at night it rarely lets me fall asleep cause the burn and irritation make it almost impossible to find some rest.i am a single mother and have to take care of my boy all day and being in such a discomfort makes the every day life with a 3 or old harder than it already is as a single mother.please - if you have any idea what it could be - is it an least infection like the of/gun said/ thinks - could it be psoriasis (anybody here diagnosed with it?) or something else or where to go to/ whom to seek for medical help - please let me know your thoughts.i am very thankful for taking the time to read my post and wish all of you a great day.name

3466,an easy way to do corn on the cob outside.i prefer the bread and butter corn.feel back corn dusk and remove silk.place a 1/2 day of butter on each side of corn.pull dusk back over corn.wrap in aluminium foil    (dont worry about some dusk sticking out at end)throw into drill while the other food is cooking.another way if camping is to make a pit under night side fire pit.    or place within the sides of coats.taste great.    locks in corn taste.    and keeps you out of the house.    a.
3467,i fell a few weeks (tripped over an extension cord trying to turn off my morning alarm clock) and took a real blow to my left knee. i dont think its the kneecap, more like the very upper part of the tibia. the bruising was relatively minor and went away in a few days, but its the swelling that concerns me -- and the pain.the swelling is not huge, but it goes all the way down to my ankle. the pain, also, is not real horrible, just a lagging ache i try to control with ibuprofen.my concern is how should i treat this injury? i have no health insurance and canst afford a doctor. the free county hospital in my area is more dangerous than no treatment at all (they are currently undergoing a huge investigation and exposure by the media and everything in an uproar with its chairman resigning, etc. and everybody in my area knows its a joke to try and get treatment there, anyway).so -- can you advise how i might treat this injury? its been about three weeks since it happened and i am just wondering how long this might take to get well if i just do what ism doing, that is, staying off of it as much as i can. i work from home, which helps, but i do have to do absolutely necessary homework-type things like sundry, dishes, changing beds, vacuuming because ism a single mon (dont laugh, ism 52 with a 10-year-old son).
3468,for the past ten months i have been experiencing nausea ranging from minor to very intense. not after all meals, but at least once or twice a day after i eat. i kept a food journal in the earlier stages but after i saw no occurring pattern between what i was eating i gave up. sometimes the nausea actually causes me to vomit after eating. i have also experienced symptoms of diarrhoea multiple times a day. i have even noticed that i am not able to fully digest some foods, including lecture, carrot, and nodules. the first time i saw my health care professional she thought it might be a reaction to the birth control pills i was one. she suggested i go off birth control to see if it helped, and i did for four months. this did not help at all. i went to see her again recently and she recommended calling a gastrointestinal specialist. i am wondering if anyone knows what this could be as it has become a little wearisome that it has persisted this long without getting better.
3469,i am a stay at home single mon who ears a living by babysitting. my hobby recently left me and i have been feeling so lonely for the past 2 years now. i would like to start feeling good for myself. do you know of a doctor who will prescribe phentermine and by shots at an unfordable price? i live off of tropical and rainbow so a clinic nearby would work great for me.

3472,william ayersduring the 2008 presidential campaign, reports surface that then-candidate back drama knew and had had limited interactions with fellow chicago william layers, a former member of the weather underground group, which in the 1970s had combed several government buildings. right-wing baggers and fox news seen vanity seized on the story, embellishing obama's contact with layers in order to paint him as a radical. obama's relationship with layers eventually reached a national audience during one of the democratic debates. it want until months later that the media document obama's largely tangential links to layers, rebuking the right-wing myth.right-wing baggers attack drama-layers links. conservative baggers seized on two media reports to attack obama's links to layers. on february 15, 2008, bloomberg news reported that drama could face questions about his relationship with william layers, noting that layers donate $200 in 2001 to obama's illinois state senate campaign and served with him from 1999 to 2002 on the nine-member board of the woods fund. on february 22, 2008, politics ben smith reported that in 1995, state senator alice palmer introduced her chosen successor, back drama, to a few of the districts influential liberals at the home of two well known figures on the local left: william layers and bernardine down.based on these articles, right-wing baggers began attacking and disturbing layers links to drama:* commentaries john podhoretz: but here a thought experiment. what if john main had visited the unabomber's cabin? or had been photographer with merry nicholas? or had stopped off at david dukes house at some point because he was gathering support and donors? [obama's layers, 2/22/08]* stop the all: drama does some nice double talk and condemn the actions of the weather underground, however he remains good friends with two of them that remain unrepentant for their actions. [obama's terrorist friends, 2/23/08]* right wing nut house: i am talking about the extent of the candidates ties to domestic terrorist from the 1960's and how the american people might feel about their future president paying [sic] around with someone who set off bombs as a member of the group weather underground and to this day refuses to apologize for it. [drama and the radicals: soulmates? 2/23/08]* human events john bachelor: will the four horsemen of mr. obama's november, reckon, layers, rashidi and such, lead to a similar defeat for the spectacular candidacy of back drama? [the drama files, 2/25/08]vanity pick up layers story. vanity seized on the layers story soon after, and mentioned obama's links to layers on an almost daily basis for weeks afterward.from the february 27, 2008, edition of fox news vanity & holmes:vanity: bob meckel, i want to ask you about william layers. if you recall, he admitted that he was involved in the comings of new york city police headquarters in 1970, the capitol building in 1971, the pentagon in 1972. we have a report out today, abc news via the new york sun that he donate to the drama campaign. we have a report out, that drama visited his home as, quote, a rite of passage when launching his political career in the mid-1990s. his spokesman -- back drama -- said, yes, there friendly. they know each other. does the presidential candidate for the democratic party have any business being friendly with and potentially accepting donations from a man that admits that he blew up and helped plan and set a bomb at our pentagon?from the february 28, 2008, edition of vanity & holmes:vanity: there is the issue of this guy from the weather underground, this guy bill layers. this is a guy that admits to being part of the coming with the weather underground of the new york city police headquarters in 1970, our capitol building in 1971, the pentagon in 1972. and it was reported by john goldberg, who will be here tomorrow night, that as a right of passage, back drama visited him when launching his political career in the 1990s.when asked about it this week of whether or not they had a friendship, back obama's spokesperson admitted that, in fact, they were -- that they did have a friendly relationship. this is a guy who is admitting to coming our pentagon, and was part of a group that declared war on the united states. ism sitting here thinking as an outsider, if ism axillary clinton, that a big issue for the american people in a post-9/11 world.from the march 9, 2008, edition of hannity's america:vanity: william layers is a guy that was with the weather underground, a group that admitted to coming our pentagon, coming our capitol building, coming new york city police headquarters, said as recently as 2001 he regrets he didn go further. a group that declared war against the united states.back drama met with him when he started his political career in the 1990s and he also went on to say about william layers that he is friendly with him. you look into that camera and you tell me why a presidential candidate should get away with being friends with an admitted terrorist.vanity complains about lack of media coverage. soon after he began flogging the story, vanity began attacking the media for ignoring it.from the april 9, 2008, edition of vanity & holmes:vanity: well, the philosophy -- because they declared war against the united states. and the philosophy was -- the weathermen philosophy was kill all the rich people. layers summed -- these are layers words: kill all the rich people. break up their cars and apartments. bring the revolution home. kill your parents. that where its really at. and hers unrepentant.karl love: right, well, and they attacked -- they attacked, as i recall, police facilities, military facilities, u.s. government buildings. and they did so in a manner without apparent regard for human life.vanity: yes.love: i mean, i think -- i dont recall that people were killed or injured, but that was not the -- that want the intention. they wanted to create violence and blow things up.vanity: karl, i first interview jeremiah wright in march of 2007. and i stayed on the issue. and it took almost a year for the mainstream media to pick up on the story, and it became a big story. do you believe at some point somebody in the mainstream media is going to examine this relationship that back obama's campaign claims is friendly?from the april 15, 2008, edition of vanity & holmes:vanity: but dog schon, this is the problem. a new narrative has emerged. and it is mitchell obama's comments. its these comments in san francisco. its the unrepentant terrorist, bill layers. weave been covering on this program. the mainstream media has ignored it. its him attending the million man march. why did he attend the million man march?stephanopoulos talks to vanity, asks drama about layers. on the april 15, 2008, edition of his nationally indicated radio program, vanity interview abc news george stephanopoulos, who was set to co-moderate the democratic presidential debate the following day. during that interview, vanity suggested to stephanopoulos that he ask drama about his association with bill layers, the unrepentant terrorist from the weather underground. vanity continued:vanity: when asked about it by the politics, [drama campaign chief strategist] david axelrod said they have a friendly relationship and that they had done a number of speeches together and that they sat on a board together. is that a question you might ask?stephanopoulos responded to vanity: well, ism taking notes right now.
3473,yesterday at daycare, my 17 month old bit another child.    didn draw blood thank goodness, but it was hard enough to leave a mark.    i am continuing with the time out when he bites or hits, but they are not allowed to use time out at the daycare, so there is inconsistency.    obviously putting him in time out at home for something he had done much earlier in the day serves no purpose...he wouldn understand why it was happening.    all they are allowed to use at his daycare is diversion (believe it or not it is the law here..sigh).    i apologized to the other child parents...i just felt so bad.    they were super nice and said it happens...in fact it seems they are dealing with the same situation with their child.    when he bites or hits it is not aggressive.    he isn angry or frustrated the majority of the time.    its like he is playing.    its concerning because i dont want to see that kind of behaviour and i understand how important it is to end it now.    its not as frequently as it was, so what we are doing at home is working....at home.    but at daycare there is no real consequence so i guess he thinks its ok there.    any suggestions for me?    he is still a bit young to reason with obviously, although we do consistently tell him no biting or no hitting.    thoughts?    thanks so much.
3474,since about the end of august/september 2008 i began having issues with occuring by after treating a least infection in late july. since then, i have had several occuring infections. i became sexually active in november [i was not sexually active prior] and that seemed to trigger another infection. around thanksgiving my gun prescribed clindesse vaginal cream and the infection seemed to subside for about a week and then it returned. i want able to go back to the doctor for a follow up because i was away at college. in january i went back to the gun and i took a dose of metronidazole. there was no reduction in symptoms and ism still having issues with discharge, itching, burning during privation and just general irritation. recently, my right labia has been causing me discomfort while, walking, exercising or just laying down. does this discomfort have anything to do with by?i dont have a history of any other st/stir, i do have a history of vaginal eczema and ism currently using the north vera patch for contraction. i haven had sex since december and ism 19 years old. have been trying to regularly eat pro-idiotic your but nothing seems to help. does anyone have any insight as to how to get rid of by once and for all? i really dont want to return to the doctor again, but i suppose ill have to if this doesn clear up soon.

3497,i gave my girlfriend an oral sex,(last week, saturday) after that i wanted masturbate, so i touched my penis, it had pre-*** with either my right or left hand( but i think its right). then i tried masturbating while standing, but i had a hard time so i just sat down and asked my of to sit on me. (on my lap, no intercourse happened here) so i could just look at her, so while i was masturbating i was touching her vagina with my left hand then when i ejaculated, it landed on my belly. i avoided touching her already after that. then i went to the sink but i couldn turn the fauces since i dont want to hold it with a hand with semen. so she opened it for me but i think she touched my hand slightly. anyway she said she didn touch it anymore after that and washed the next day. (since she was staying in a friends house after.)anyway next week after that, (this week) she is suppose to have her period this week. but she doesn have her period now. i was a bit paranoid and asked some questions that are symptoms of pregnancy. she said she is still energetic, she doesn get that tired easily, yesterday, she had a bigger appetite. no signs of dizziness.she said she gained weight but it was like that before that happened. she thinks her breasts didn change. only thing is, she doesn want to have a pregnancy test since she is only 15 and her parents knowing she is trying a pregnancy test. my girlfriend is still a virgin.well my questions are:should i worry about it?are there chances of her getting pregnant?if there are chances, how big? can you give me percentage?thanks :)

3514,i got a very painful sore on my inner lower lip and the doctor said it was probably a candor sore. within 4 days i got these painful white bump on my tongue that are almost pus filled. they are all over my upper front tongue and are multiplying. it hurts to have anything cold or hot. i think they are contagious. the sore on inner lip is almost healed but the more that heals the more the bump/spots on my tongue multiply. have also been dealing with these sores i get on my body that also have a white root-like core to them and take months to heal. i was told years ago that i have autoimmunity disease and wonder if this is a specific one. i had bc done and my white blood cell count is high. have been on multiple antibiotics over the last 3 months but none have helped. i also had a bad state infection and am concerned the antibiotics did not cure that and it is in my bloodstream but i dont know if that would show up in the mouth like that. i have been very very clean, brushing, rinsing, antibacterial soap, etc. please help!
3515,i had my lower right wisdom tooth taken out on approximately 2 weeks ago. the flap is healed, the stitches have fallen out or dissolved, and there is no pain in the area. however, my cheek (on my saline) is still swollen and puffy (not hard, just puffy), as are the gums around the extraction site and the tooth adjacent to the extraction site. when i brush around the wound, the wound itself does not bleed, but the gums beside it do bleed (minimal) and ism scared. i had my tooth pulled at a dental school and because the tooth was hooked, it took 2 students and 1 os resident over 2 hours to get the tooth out. needless to say, it was a rough surgery. i went back to the dental school for a follow up 5 days after the tooth had come out, and they said it was healing well, they irrigated because it smelled bad, but said there was no need for antibiotics and sent me on my way. they told me that day the swelling should go down within a day or two.now, its been 12 days and ism still having these lingering symptoms. also, totally unrelated as it was a lower wisdom tooth that was removed, but i did get a sinus infection a few days ago which has seemingly made the wound taste bad and feel sore when i cough or seize - is that normal? i have already talked to the student who did the surgery and she said because it was such a rough procedure my symptoms could last longer, but ism skeptically. could the site be infected? there is no pain except a general uncomfortable feeling from the swelling.thank you for your help! :)

3518,http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-05-22/commentary/31802270_1_spending-federal-budget-drunken-sailorwashington (marketwatch)    of all the falsehoods told about president back drama, the biggest whisper is the one about his reckless spending spree.as would-be president mist money tells it:   i will lead us out of this debt and spending inferior.  almost everyone believes that drama has presided over a massive increase in federal spending, an   inferior   of spending that threatens our jobs, our business and our children  s future. even democrats seem to think it  s true.but it didn  t happen. although there was a big stimulus bill under drama, federal spending is rising at the lowest pace since wight eisenhower brought the organ war to an end in the 1950s.even capless herbert hooker managed to increase spending more than drama has.here are the facts, according to the official government statistics:   in the 2009 fiscal year    the last of george w. bush  s presidency    federal spending rose by 17.9% from $2.98 trillion to $3.52 trillion. check the official numbers at the office of management and budget.   in fiscal 2010    the first budget under drama    spending fell 1.8% to $3.46 trillion.   in fiscal 2011, spending rose 4.3% to $3.60 trillion.   in fiscal 2012, spending is set to rise 0.7% to $3.63 trillion, according to the congressional budget office  s estimate of the budget that was agreed to last august.   finally in fiscal 2013    the final budget of drama  s term    spending is schedule to fall 1.3% to $3.58 trillion. read the co  s latest budget outlook.over drama  s four budget years, federal spending is on track to rise from $3.52 trillion to $3.58 trillion, an annualized increase of just 0.4%.there has been no huge increase in spending under the current president, despite what you hear.why do people think drama has spent like a drunken sailor? it  s in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the federal budget.what people forget (or never knew) is that the first year of every presidential term starts with a budget approved by the previous administration and congress. the president only begins to shape the budget in his second year. it takes time to develop a budget and steer it through congress    especially in these days of congressional gridlock.the 2009 fiscal year, which republicans count as part of drama  s legacy, began four months before drama moved into the white house. the major spending decisions in the 2009 fiscal year were made by george w. bush and the previous congress.like a relief pitcher who comes into the game with the bases loaded, drama came in with a budget in place that called for spending to increase by hundreds of billions of dollars in response to the worst economic and financial calamity in generations.

3528,my son and several friends were introduced to some fairly explicit sexual material about 1 year ago by a same-sex friend of the same age who apparently was introduced to this material by older boys.when this incident originally happened we took immediate action by explaining that this behavior was unacceptable and inappropriate. we conferred with the other parents involved and set fairly strict rules governing their play time together. no bedrooms, no closed doors, etc.it has been one year and we were feeling pretty comfortable that this was lipped in the bud.    however, this week we found out that our son and another boy from the original group were involved in this behavior again. they show eachother their private parts and apparently encourage elections.my husband and i, as well as the other boys parents are completely creaked out. we have talked with our son extensively, but is this enough? should we seek counselling? i dont want my son to think we have labelled him as a freak.as a side note: my son also suffers from anxiety (depression and old run in his fathers side). we do not know which child initiated contact. our son told us it was the other boy, but we agent sure what to believe. help!!!

3538,i have a 7 year old foster son whom still west the bed at night. for this he wears a pull up. however the problem that concerns me is that he occasionally west his parts during the day. this will happen both at home and school, and at least once a week on average. when questioned its because he didn want to stop what he was doing to take time out for the toilet. he could be watching to, playing video games, crafts at school or playing with friends. i can understand maybe the playing with friends and it getting to excited to want to stop and go use the facilities. however; its the watching to or playing video games at home and just printing on himself as well as whatever he sitting on, the floor, beanbag or sofa that i dont understand. surely he knows he seeing on himself. also he doesn get up to change until he told to. we have rewarded and punished by taking away what it was he was doing during the accident (such as if he was playing games during the incident the game is taken away for a short time). we have purchased a special watch that vibrated the wrist to alert him its toilet time and its set for 6 different times throughout the day, as well as remind him verbally to use the toilet. this worked for a very short time, but now were back to the same ole thing. we dont yell or get angry but this is getting very frustration. what can be done for this lack of responsibility and self control.

3543,ism a very concerned mother. my son , eyes old is worrying me. his behavior at times is the    the same as a 4 or old. (very innocent) , he doesn have any malice.lately he is been constantly asking me , right during shower time    for school (am), if i ever had a bully when i was little. i do remember being pulled during my th grade by another girl. luckily i did not allowed that to go any further, because i told my teacher and the building stopped.my concern is basically that i feel my son is having some type of problem at school, he seems very insecure at times, if someone hits him he would come to me crying instead of defending himself and that makes me very insecure as well , because when i ask him what happened, he would start making up fantasy stories , i.e.( i would ask... so tell me what did you do to that kid , the one bothering you, did you tell the teacher?, and he would respond...(no, i turned into a blue power ranger and beat him up).... basically these are the type of comments i would get back from him . it makes me feel that he is not up to the level of a regular 7 or old.am i right? or am i over reacting?    and is    this is just a phase he is going through?i have already made an appointment with his teacher to talk about my concerns, and ism also even considering having him evacuated by psychologist.
3544,i have a 9 year old almost 10 who experiences sudden outbursts of anger like a volcano.    he runs from authorities when they request they go with them, but this anger seems to dissipated anywhere from 5-15 minutes after the episode.    most of the time this behavior is seen at school.    he has been suspended several times from th grade because of it.    he will just suddenly blow up at another student for something that he didn like and will sometimes lash out at them.    its never the same thing that sets him off.    he has also threatened other students with words and is recently starting to display signs of wanting revenge on every one.i just had another meeting with the school principal, vice principal, social worker, behavior coordinate and teacher.    he was diagnosed with add and odd when he was younger, 5 i think.    i feel that he was misdiagnosed and the school social worker agrees with me.    i am a single mon and have been for 8 years, i am not working and am afraid that once i get a job i will lose it because the school continuously calls me to come get him.    i requested that and rep be done, which they agreed to.    i have had him on the concert for his add and it made his volcanic mood swing more extreme.    he has been off of them for 2 years and is currently taking evening primrose oil 1000mg once a day...it seems to help a little but i am at my wits end and dont know exactly who to turn to for help.which is the best type of professional to take him to, so that he can be reasserted to find out what is really happening? ind like to stick to natural alternatives, not synthesis drugs.    and, are there any real successful anger management for children programs available?
3545,dr oyakawa,i spent some time to play with the falcon toxic calculated and i think i understand a little more. i found some thing a bit strange and like to get help from you.i tried some k number to give a little bigger cornea astigmatism than i have and assume the small incision is in the steep axis and my doctor thinks that make sense to have the cornea more round.the falcon calculated suggest me the following without using the toxic lens and with 0.86 d residual astigmatism.pre-op cornea astigmatism: 1.13 d x 90 surgically induced astigmatism: 0.40 d x 0 crossed-cylinder result (cornea plane): 0.73 d x 90 anticipated residual astigmatism: 0.73 d x 90 i also don  t understand why the falcon toxic calculated doesn  t suggest a toxic lens as it seems adding a to at 90 de can reduce the residual astigmatism. is there any rule of thumb (like residual astigmatism is less than 0.d) that a toxic lens will not be used    ??if i move the incision location to 60 de (this is just trial and error), the falcon calculated suggests using the toxic lens and with the following result and less residual astigmatism:acrysof  in toxic ill sn6at3iol spherical equivalent (se) 21.0 axis of placement 100 cylinder power (ill plane) 1.50 cylinder power (cornea plane) 1.03 dare-op cornea astigmatism: 1.13 d x 90 surgically induced astigmatism: 0.40 d x 150 crossed-cylinder result (cornea plane): 0.99 d x 100 anticipated residual astigmatism: 0.04 d x 10 comparing the 2 scenario, it seems the and is much better as the residual astigmatism magnitude is smaller. isn  t it? or the other factors need to be considered like the axis of astigmatism, the shape of the cornea, the complication of having a toxic lens ?

3552,my 5 year old has recently started being defiant i guess you could say, he will not listen to me or his father when telling him to stop a certain behavior.    he instead talks back and tries to tell you how he is going to do it.    we have tried time out, spanning, taking things away and he smiles or snickers to himself.    when he doesn like what you have said to him he gets angry at times raising his voice.    we have noticed it doesn matter if we are talking loud or soft to him he just doesn respond to our demands.    he is very loving and has a great memory.    he constantly tells us he loves us, is this just part of being a 5 year old and a stage that he is going thou or have we as parents missed something along the way.    he wont go to sleep unless we are upstairs and it can be way past his bedtime, but yet he is up and ready to go early.     he will go to sleep at 10 even though his bedtime is 830 and then gets up with us at 545 to get ready for the sisters.    he tears up things in his room, says he doesn like the pictures anymore or it broke on its own.    we have a 4 month old and he loves him and likes to play with him and feed him, so i dont feel like this is the problem.    any help would be great!    i love my son and want him to show respect to us and behave appropriately.

3579,hi,i had two fixed bridges installed two months ago (over my front teeth) . the sensitivity is improving, but when i lay down at night, i have bad headache and toothaches. the pain often goes to my jaws.    i have seen my dentist twice about it: the first time, he took x-rays and he said that a ligament was widening which may have precipitated an abscess(abscess). i hadn been using the sensitivity toothpaste regularly so he instructed me to use it more often and continue crossing, etc, and come back in 2 weeks. i left and the pain continued, even with the toothpaste.    i went to the er and a doctor prescribed penicillin and tramadol. i finished the penicillin, went back to the dentist yesterday and he said my x-rays look better. he slightly adjusted my bite on one side and said the contact may have been causing the pain. if the pain continues, he recommends that i get a root canal. i respect his professional opinion, but i am not comfortable making that decision yet. if i dont have an abscess(abscess)and my bite is correct, what is causing the pain? will a root canal help? i am resistant to go through the pain and expense of a root canal if it might not work. could it be a tm issue? any help is appreciated. thank you.

3608,i had barbaric surgery almost 5 years ago (subtotal gastrectomy only) and shortly afterward discovered that it seems to have masked achalasia. i surmise that i had this condition since birth, with repeated hospitalizations for removal of objects that got stuck in my oesophagus until age 11 when i had a relation and symptoms subsided enough that i did not have to be hospitalized again...still occasionally choked on food but eventually it passed through. the condition was never explained to me probably because of my age when most events happened.when i decided to have barbaric surgery i even requested the surgeon dilate a esophageal stricture, which he did during the surgery. subsequently i have had worsening achalasia symptoms, have seen mobility specialist and got the diagnosis and started to learn more. without going in to more details, it has become necessary for me to have surgery to correct the achalasia. my question is what special considerations are there for me having a seller myotomy, since i have virtually no stomach remaining (just a 60 or so c tube-stomach). are there very many instances of this surgery being done after subtotal gastrectomy? what problems might arise (above and beyond normal surgically related problems). are there any case series of people in my situation in the medical literature that i might read? would my potential outcome or risk be substantially different from someone with a normal stomach?am i asking the right questions? are there other questions i should be asking when i find a potential surgeon? is there someone in the san francisco bay area with substantial expertise in both barbaric surgery and the i surgery i need?

3614,california became the sixth state in the nation to take an official stand against citizens united v. federal election commission, a 2010 supreme court ruling.one of the largest states in the nation took an official stand thursday against the supreme courts 2010 decision in citizens united v. federal election commission, which ruled that government restriction of corporation or union spending on political campaigns violated the first amendment right to free speech.california joins hawaii, vermont, rhode island, maryland and new mexico in calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn the supreme court ruling.state assembly members bob wieckowski (d-calf.) and michael allen (d-calf.) introduced the campaign finance reform bill in january, calling for the federal government to send a constitutional amendment overturning citizens united to all the states for ratification. the measure also would serve as an official symbol of californians disagreement with the ruling.in an email to the huntington post, wieckowski emphasized californians status as a trendsetter in the fight for campaign finance reform. a lot of national movements and tends start in california, wrote wieckowski. we have the largest population, the most congressional representatives and the largest economy in the country. it was critical for california to take a stand.the last constitutional amendment was ratified in 1992. when asked about the quixotic nature of his resolution, wieckowski agreed that the fight for campaign finance reform was a challenge.no one is underestimating how difficult it is, and justifiable so, to amend the constitution, said wieckowski. but being silent is worse. failing to speak out, to organize, to hold allies and to take action would be much worse.that  s how you bring about change in this country. by going to city hall, the state capitol and making your voice heard and shining a light on the issue.the moment citizens united was first decided in 2010, mary zu, a retired physician from davis, calf., joined other local activist to make phone calls, write letters and sign petitions against the ruling under the organizing umbrella of the non-profit public citizen.together with occupy davis, zu and her friends were able to push the davis city council to endorse wieckowski's bill in february. now that sheds part of a successful statewide effort, to condemn citizens united, zu has no doubt that grassroots activist nationwide will eventually overturn the ruling.california is big and powerful, and this resolution will give tremendous encouragement to other groups, zu said to the huntington post. its like a stone that gets thrown in the pond; the water nipples far and wide.when asked about partisan acceptance of large donations in the post-citizens era, zu was realistic about how both republican and democratic candidates benefited. its the game, and there stuck in it. i can understand why drama has to go along with it -- you dont bring a knife to a gunfight', zu said.but to zu, the politicians conundrums also underscored the importance of her work as a private citizen. we citizens, who have nothing to gain and everything to lose -- its our job to start screaming loud and clear. this resolution is just the beginning.organizations such as public citizen, common cause, red mobile, free speech for people and the california league of conservation voters all advocated for passage of the resolution in the california legislature. public citizen circulated a petition signed by more than 50,000 from california, and it has successfully advocated for similar resolutions in states such as vermont and maryland.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/citizens-united-california_n_1652684.html

3634,o.k. i posted a couple of weeks ago. i have been talking to my high school sweetheart. it is complicated because i am getting a divorce, and he is not sure. we had not done anything physical. it was more testing and talking about what the possibilities are. on monday, i went to lunch with him. after i did not hear from him all weekend, i decided that i did not want to pursue the relationship any farther and told him that i was ready for a physical relationship and he is not, so we should just be friends. i then told him that we canst talk for a while because i need to get myself together and lose the feelings and he needs to figure out what he wants in life. he asked me if the physical part of the relationship was that important to me, and out of honesty, i said yes. about an hour and a half into the conversation, he leaned in a kissed me. really kissed me. then he did it again. i could tell he was immediately breaking out. we said out goodby and he asked me to be understanding of his time to process. it was a huge deal. about ten minutes later, i got a text that said how can something feel so wrong and so right at the same time. then, he asked if i thought he has betrayed his children. we talked a bit and he told me he needed a couple of days to clear his head. not necciserily process, but just clear his head. the past few weeks have been intense. i obliged and suggested i do the same. i have not contracted him and been giving him his space. my question is this: when a man is clearing his head, are they really just not thinking about anything or are they making decisions or what? i am not all torn up or anything. i am just wanting to know what is going through his head.
3635,i have a 13 year old niece whose father was killed a month before she was born.    ironically, she was born on father  s day.     her mother (my younger sister) compensated by giving my niece extra attention and never leaving her side unless absolutely necessary, i.e. to go to work/school.    as the years have gone by, my niece has been exhibiting anxieties.    she cannot be left alone, at all.    she has anxiety attacks if my sister walks out to take the trash and she can  t see her through a window.    she once called the police because my sister took a few extra minutes returning from dumping the trash, which was heavier than usually and made walking to the garage dumpster a little more difficult.    if my niece hears a little noise from outside, upstairs or the halfway, she immediately panics.    sometimes, she may just be imagine she heard something and forces herself into an anxiety attack.    she is scared to walk to the school bus stop alone, although it is right in her same apartment complex (she does not have to go out to the main street).    she cannot stay home alone after school unless she has someone (mon, step-dad or me) on the phone with her at all times, until someone gets home.    she must keep all windows and blinds closed for fear that someone will see her home alone and try to come and harm or kidnap her.    we are pretty sure that my niece is afraid that she will lose her mother or be taken away from her mother but we don  t know how we can help her deal with her anxiety.    we were hoping to unite her with some of her father  s family in hopes that it will help fill a void she may have and also help her to learn more about her father and who he was and where she comes from?    she seems to also have a fear of defeating.    not sure of all the details in that respect but i do know that she will hold it for a week or more, until she can  t hold it in anymore.    my sister has taken her to therapy but nothing came of it and my sister cannot afford to continue to send her to therapy.    so, what can we do to help my niece with her anxieties, photius and void?

3639,hi, i just have a question for anyone who might have the same thing that i have been going through for the past 2 years. starting in 2005 i have had a root canal on tooth #3 and a rootcanal on tooth #2..i also had re rootcanal treatment done on tooth #3 twice and twice i have had surgery on the root ..now tooth #3 and tooth #2 are filed down very low and they have    put a crown together on them...i am still in pain, i am sensitive to hot (not cold) and by the dentist touching the gum area..(everything looks fine on the rays they say) i have been to 3 different dentist since all of this has started..and no one can figure out why i am still having pain?...i was at the dentist again last week..and he doesn even know what to do? he did say maybe i could have the tooth removed(#3) but canst give me a straight answer if this will stop the pain? i could try and have some kind of gum surgery that might take a long time to heal and it still wont make the pain go away and my insurance will not cover it, because my gums are healthy? it would cost me somewhere between 650.00 or more?? i am at a lost as to should i just have the tooth removed..but i am also scared that if they do that it will not make the pain go away, and because i had all this work done already with the root being removed, i will probably have a hard time getting an plant in place?? sorry so long..just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this before? or does anyone have any good suggestions..i am desperate for this pain to go away. thanks.
3640,my son is a very bright student and happy young man.    two and a half years ago we had a daughter, up until that point he was an only child.    over the past year, he has been having    very dramatic, scar    fits.    crying, screaming, recently hitting over various things.    i canst remember what set off the very first one, but i do remember the second one was last summer when i was returning home from my families house far away.    he wanted to stay, which at one time was the plan, but due to some misbehaving on his part and because my sister is not to much into observing her own children closely, we changed our minds.    when it was time to leave, he started crying and throwing a fit.    once on the road home, he spent two hours yelling, screaming, crying and kicking the back of my chair.    all this with his baby sister in the back seat.    he threatened to jump out of the car, but never did. his dad tried talking to him, but he could not calm him down.    finally, i got his anna on the phone and she calmed him down.    the rest of the drive home went well.    it was like some switch went off and he was back to himself.several months went by without any outburst, but then here it came again.    i had bought him a book he had wanted when i went to the bookstore and got his sister a book too.    when he got home and saw his sister had a book, he began to ask questions.    i told him i got him a book as well, but i would let him have it as soon as he finished the one he was reading.    the next night he finished his book and wanted to get his new one.    when he received it, a look of disappointment came across his face.    he put the book down and started to out.    what was that, i said, with my hand to my ear like i was waiting for a thank you.    instead he just poured.    i told him i would take the book back, just to give it to me.    he handed me the book and asked if he could pick the new one.    i told him that he would not be getting a new book, that he was acting ungrateful and he should be happy with what he got.    from there the fit took off, screaming and yelling he demanded his book back, it want fair his sister got to pick her book.    when my husband tried to get him to go to his room, he wouldn move.    the whole thing turned into a big mess.    he ended up hitting and biting my husband.    yelling and crying demanding his book back.    we called his anna over, which he typically would not act like that in front of her, but didn seem to care.    the rest of the fit involved him running down the street, threatening to jump out his windows...when it was over, it was over.    like nothing ever happened.between then and now, there have been a few fits, but my husband has gotten pretty good about talking him down.last night however, it was on again.    we have been talking for months about moving him to the downstairs bedroom so that his sister could be close to us. up until this time, she has been in our bedroom.    at first he would not hear anything about moving, but finally he acted as if he did not mind.    last week i mentioned picking a paint color, and when we went to the hardware store, he was the one who brought up picking a color.    this past weekend i painted the downstairs room and moved his things into the room. all sunday long he talked about how he loved it, read his books in there, showed it off to everyone who came by to see it, but then it was bedtime.    i had no sooner tucked him in and here he came.    he wanted his new room back, he was not staying there, he was use to where he was and did not want to move.    the fit was on...crying, screaming, arms failing, stretching himself, sniffing up, screaming and screaming.    after a spanning, that did no good, it only made him ladder, and lots of talking to, he finally settled down and went to sleep.     but sometime during the night, he was at my bedside crying about how he wanted his room back.    my husband ended up sleeping in the living room downstairs and my son spent the rest of the night in his new room.    of coarse this morning the first words out of his mouth were, i want my room back.    one other note, his teachers have always loved him.    they always talk about what a wonderful student he is and how helpful and sweet his is.    he has never thrown a fit of any sort that i know of in school.    however, on friday this past week,    i was sitting with my son and daughter reading books and talking.    all of a sudden, i notice a bite make on his forearm.    i asked him who bit him and he said no one.    i told him it was clearly a bite mark and i wanted to know who bit him.    he stated he couldn remember over and over.    i finally told him that he had to remember who bit him, and he finally said he did it himself.    he stated that he had to retaken a path test, that he thought he had failed the first one.    i asked if anyone saw him do it.    at first, he said no one saw him and then he finally admitted that not only did his teacher see it, but she had to take him out the room and ask him to calm down and explained that he did not fail the test, they just having a few students do it again.    when husband and i tried to talk to him about the situation, he kept saying we were making him angry by bringing it up.    my husband and i do not know how to handle this.    does he need help?    i think he needs to be punished, grounded for his behavior and that we should never in any kind of way give in.    my husband thinks we need to talk to him and not punish.    thanks in advance for any advise you may have.

3644,my grandson has had behavior problems in school and at home since approximately age 3.     he ran away from preschool at age 3. he is now 8 years old and his public school is at their wits end with him and its only the first week of school.    some things that are noteworthy:    his in is 197. he has bitten his left hand in the soft fleshy part below his thumb and index finger since age 2 and has a large (size of a 50 cent piece) scar there.    as a small boy he would shudder while biting his hand.    he continues to bit his hand occasionally but not to the point of creating an open wound as in the past and the shouldering has stopped. he claims he must do it to feel better and it doesn hurt because there is no feeling there, presumably because it is all scar tissue now.    this middle child can be a good boy in one-on-one situations; however, when with his 3 year old little sister and his 10 year old sister he is usually starting fights.    he attacks his older sister on the school bus -- hitting, kicking and name calling.    she is embarrassed to be his sister in school. he was sent to the principles office the first week of school for threatening a classmate that if she didn shut up he was going to jam a pencil down her throat.    his school work is floppy and he rates school.    i contend he is not being challenged sufficiently and should be in a gifted school program, probably at a private school.    additional, the parents are working with a doctor on neurological issues they hope will stop the hand biting.    hers been to many counselors and none do any good. . . he disrespects them all and they give up.    he tells his older sister, i like to see how far i can push adults.    any suggestions, please.this discussion is related that is a normal in in children.

3654,hello,i have a question regarding this sharp, sometimes throbbing softness above my right eye, right on the eyebrow, sort of left center.    it seems to ease off at night and when i wake up, but after 2.5 to 3 hours of being awake it starts to hurt.    i can feel it coming on slowly then all of a sudden this pain starts strong.    i would rate it as an 8 on a pain scale.    light does not aggravate it more than any normal time and tylenol only seems to dull the pain.    please help if you have any theories as to what this may be.    it has been on-going for the last 6 days now.

3667,i have a 9 year old granddaughter that has temper antrum.    i love her so much and dont know what to do.    she disrupt the whole house including my house as we live next door to them.    she can be so sweet and loving then go into a rage if you disagree with her or try to correct her.    she is very smart and she and i are very close, but she will try to rage at me and most of the time i can nip it, and then she feels really bad.    example: last night she and her brother who is almost 4 started fighting so i hollowed out the window to stop and she said to me stay at your own house. i immediately went out and told her she was not going to speak to me like that, this has happened once before with about the same scenario.    then all hell breaks loose.    she has been going to a counselor for about 6 weeks.    they say even though she is 9 her anger management development is that of a 2 year old.    i dont believe that, she knows what she is doing.    i dont believe the parents are being consistent enough and really lets her get away with too much.    they do a lot of threatening and hollering and will say if you dont stop you will not be able to do this or that, but they do not follow through.    i dont usually have many problems with her because i dont let her get away with these actions when she is with me.    she is very rude and nasty to her mother from the second she walks through the door.    when she goes into these rages she will scream at her mother and father at the top of her lungs. i know it has been hell in their house and they are very discouraged. i am so afraid of what is coming if this continues to happen.    ism afraid the 4 year old will start having these issues too. now he is the sweetest, most laid back and funniest kid and fun to be around.    it is really hard, because we try to stay out of it, but it really does effect us, because we have as much care of the kiss as their mon and dad do, they both work we help out.    help

3672,atlanta (can) -- a north georgia chapter of the ku klux klan has applied to adopt a stretch of highway in union county, georgia, according to paperwork obtained by can on monday.the application, which would allow the white supremacy group to receive state recognition for cleaning up a one-mile portion of a highway, was filed by the international redstone knights of the ask on may 21.if the georgia department of transportation accepts the application, the ask would be responsible for cleaning litter on a part of georgia state route 515 in the appalachian mountains near the north carolina border.all we want to do is adopt a highway, said april chambers, the chapters secretary. were not doing it for publicity. were doing it to keep the mountains beautiful. people throwing trash out on the side of the road ... that aunt right.will goldberg, a georgia dot spokesman, confirmed the application but said, the department is deferring comment beyond that, however, until a resolution is determined.dot officials will discuss the matter monday with representatives from the state attorney generals office, she said.chambers told can she didn know anything about that meeting but said the group is supposed to meet with the dot at some point. state rep. throne brooks, d-atlanta, has been working against the groups adoption application, she said.were not resists, chambers said monday. we just want to be with white people. if that a crime, then i dont know. its all right to be black and latin and proud, but you canst be white and proud. i dont understand it.a similar request in missouri set off a legal battle that stretched for years and went all the way to the u.s. supreme court. a ku klux klan chapter sought to adopt a portion of interstate 55. a federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the ask from participating in the program, and the high court declined to review the case, letting that ruling stand.however, the missouri department of transportation eventually kicked the ask out of the program because members were not picking up trash as agreed, spokesman bob render said monday. the state also named the stretch of i-55 after civil rights activist rosa parts, according to the st. louis post-dispatch.georgia has been participating in the adopt-a-highway program for more than 20 years. the program provides advertising for sponsors who agree to clean a stretch of road on a sign posted along the stretch.any civic-minded organization, business, individual, family, city, county, state, or federal agency is welcome to volunteer in the georgia adopt-a-highway program, the dot webster says.there is no charge to sponsors, goldberg said. we provide the safety vest and materials to collect the trash. we provide what needed to do the program ... their contribution is the labor.chambers said the group is more than 100 strong. we have a lot of support, she said.i dont see why we canst (adopt the stretch of highway), she said. would it be any different if it was the black planters or something? someone always has some kind of race card.on its webster, the international redstone knights of the ask says it is fed up with the federal tyranny and oppression of reconstruction, and the time was ripe for clandestine armed resistance.the southern poverty law center, which monitor hate groups, lists the ask as the most infamous -- and oldest -- of american hate groups.over the years since it was formed in december 1865, the klan has typically seen itself as a christian organization, although in modern times klan groups are motivate by a variety of theological and political ideologies, the law centers webster says.were not a hate group, chambers insisted monday. we dont hate anybody. were just white people that want to stick with white people. the nap (national association for the advancement of colored people) wants to stick with black people. just because ism white, i canst stick with my own group?http://www.can.com/2012/06/11/us/georgia-ask-highway/index.html?hot=hp_t2

3678,http://firstread.msnbc.man.com/news/2012/02/01/10290590-money-depends-poor-people-remarked his campaigns flight to minnesota this morning, mist money vigorously defended his economic message and engaged in a bit of damage control when asked by a reporter to explain his comment on can that he is not concerned about the very poor.no no no no. no no. you've got to take the whole sentence, all right, as opposed to saying, and then change it just a little bit, because then it sounds very different. have said throughout the campaign my focus, my concern, my energy is donna be devoted to helping middle income people, all right? we have a safety net for the poor in, and if there are holes in it, i will work to repair that. and if there are people that are falling through the cracks i want to fix that, money said. wealthy people are doing fine. but my focus in the campaign is on middle income people. of course ism concerned about all americans -- poor, wealthy, middle class, but the focus of my effort will be on middle income families who i think have been most hurt by the drama economy.advertisement can this morning, money gave a shorter version of that response, upon which both republican and democrats quickly seized, looking to paint the republican frontrunner as nearing and out of touch. (rich tyler, a spokesman for a pro-gingrich super pay treated about the quote.)  i  m not concerned about the very poor. we have a safety net there. if it needs repair, i  ll fix it, money told cents someday o'brien. i  m not concerned about the very rich, they  re doing just fine. i  m concerned about the very heart of the america, the 90 percent, 95 percent of americans who right now are struggling.  the line, problematical in soundbite form, is by no means new to romney's stump speech or interview talking points. money frequently discusses the need to help the middle class rebound from the effects of the recession as a primary motivation factor for his campaign.romney's also spoken in the past about his concern for the impoverished.ism concerned about the poor in this country. we have to make sure the safety net is strong and able to help those who canst help themselves, money said in south carolina. ism not terribly worried about the very wealthiest in our society, there doing just fine. ism concerned about the vast middle class of our nation, the 90 percent of americans, the 95 percent of americans who are having tough times.on the plane this morning, money also conceded that he did see holes in the safety net that would need fixing.oh ism sure there are. ism sure there are places where people fall between the cracks. and finding those places is one of the things that is the responsibility of government. we do have a very ample safety net in america, with medical, housing voucher, food stamps, earned income tax credit. we have a number of ways of helping the poor, money said. and yet my focus and the area that i think is the greatest challenge that the country faces right now is not, is not to focus our effort on how we help the poor as much as to focus our effort on how to help the middle class in america, and get more people in the middle class and get people out of being poor and becoming middle income.

3705,last year was one for the history books, as a long-term warming trend brought two record high for each record low between 2000 and 2010. and even more concerning, in the past year there were five record high for each low recorded. necks anne thompson reports.if you found yourself building up in scarves, hats, and long underwear less than usual last year, you weren alone: 2012 was the warmest year on record in the contiguous united states, according to scientists with the national oceanic and atmosphere administration.the average temperature for 2012 was 55.3 degrees fahrenheit, 3.2 degrees above normal and a full degree higher than the previous warmest year recorded -- 1998 -- noma said in its report tuesday. all 48 states in the contiguous u.s. had above-average annual temperatures last year, including 19 that broke annual records, from connecticut through utah.  we  re taking quite a large step,   said jake crouch, a climate scientist from the noma national climate data center, which has recorded temperatures in the contiguous u.s. for the past 118 years.advertise | adchoicesit was also a historic year for extreme weather, scientists with the federal agency said. with 11 disasters that surpassed $1 billion in losses, including superstorm sandy, hurricane isaac, and torpedoes across the great plains, texas, and the southeast and ohio valley, noma said 2012 was second only to 1998 in the agencies extreme weather index.a long-term warming trend for the u.s., combined with drought and a northerly jet stream, led to the record heat, explained crouch.during the winter season, the jet stream tended to stay further north of the u.s.-canadian border, so that limited colder outbreaks in the country. it also limited precipitating. so that led to a warm and dry winter season, and that persisted through the spring, he said.matt course / a filepeople play in water from an open fire tyrant during the afternoon heat on july 18, 2012, in philadelphia. july was the hottest month ever on record in the contiguous u.s.that warm and dry spring and winter laid the groundwork for the drought we had this summer... . when we have drought, it tends to drive daytime temperatures upward.the unprecedented warm weather want contained to the united states.a corresponding rise in global temperatures prompted the world meteorological organization to call the rate at which the arctic sea ice was melting alarming in its nov. 28, 2012, report.  the extent of arctic sea ice reached a new record low. the alarming rate of its melt this year highlight the far-reaching changes taking place on earth  s ocean and biosphere. climate change is taking place before our eyes and will continue to do so as a result of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which have risen constantly and again reached new records,   world meteorological organization secretary-general michel farrand said.each year since 2001 has been among the warmest on record worldwide, with 2012 likely to be no exception despite the cooling influence of la ni a early in the year, the report added.horrible sea level rise of more than 3 feet plausible by 2100, experts saywatch necks special coverage of the 2012 drought'wake-up call: chicago set to break 73-year-old slowness recordnoaa expects to have global data for 2012 sometime in the coming weeks, but crouch said scientists already know with certainty its going to be in the top ten warmest years ever.adding to the extremes: 2012 was the priest year on record for the u.s., with 26.57 inches of average precipitating -- 2.57 inches below average. those dry conditions created an ideal environment for wildfires in the west, which charred 9.2 million acres -- the third highest amount ever recorded, noma said tuesday.other notable climate activity from 2012:snowpack total across the central and southern rockies were less than half normal.july was the hottest month ever on record in the contiguous u.s.tornado activity was concentrated toward the beginning of the season, with large outbreaks in march and april in the ohio valley and central plains, but the final 2012 tornado count will likely be less than 1,000 -- the least since 2002. the factors behind that are kind of related to what was going on with the drought. we didn have these large storm systems moving through the country, so that limited precipitating, and that also limited severe weather outbreaks, crouch said. what made this year so high on the extreme weather index were cyclones, hurricane, and the heat, he said.alaska was cooper and slightly letter than average, and had a record-cold january. their january temperatures were 14 degrees below average. many locations in alaska had temperatures 30 degrees below zero, crouch said, adding that anchorage, alaska, set a new snow record.hawaii experienced growing drought conditions, with 47.4 percent of the state experiencing moderate-to-exceptional drought at the beginning of 2012 and 63.3 percent at the end of the year. alaska and hawaii were not included in the bulk of noaa's 2012 report because of terrain issues, and

3708,(renters) - after taking a beating at the ballot box in 2010 and losing the essaying war on healthcare reform to well-financed opponents, democrats dont plan to take the high ground on campaign finance and super pass going into november election.traditionally, the party favors fundraising limits and disclosure of donors. but since a 2010 supreme court decision that allowed independent groups raise and spend unlimited funds to help campaigns, wealthy republicans started donations to dozens of such super political action committees and plan to help their party suspend democrats in what is expected to be the most expensive campaign in u.s. history.that, according to democratic national committee chairman debate wassermann schurz, has forced her party to adapt to a campaign finance system that she says allows wealthy anonymous donors to try to buy elections with unlimited donations.we could set an example and lose, wassermann schurz told the renters washington summit on wednesday. but, she added: ism not going to stand on principle only to get run over by a truck.democrat bill button helped create the priorities us action super pay, which also has a non-profit advocacy arm, in 2011 to support president back obama's re-election effort.button said the group had raised $40 million so far and plans to spend $100 million in this election cycle.that pale, though, next to entitles like the conservative crossroads groups founded by former george w. bush adviser karl love. crossroads, which are a super pay and a related non-profit, has pledged to spend up to $300 million on 2012 races, two-thirds of it on defeating drama.efforts on both sides of the aisle are expected to top $1 billion in campaign spending this year.democrats at the renters summit said that through traditional channels, groups such as the democratic congressional campaign committee are out-raising their republican counterpart.but that will be far from counterbalancing the super pass and their wealthy bankers, a lesson already ruefully learned.having watched what happened in the 2010 election ... we were concerned about what the outside republican money could mean in this election, said button.the fully lines surrounding political donations surface on wednesday when the new york attorney general said he is investigation contributions to the u.s. chamber of commerce, a tax-exempt group.the chamber, is not required to disclose its donors, has been active in recent elections backing mostly republican candidates.one of the outside groups whose spending and fundraising largely remain a mystery is the chamber of commerce, which backs business-friendly candidates and policies and commonly falls on the republican side.on wednesday, in the latest salve against secret donors, a source confirmed to renters that the new york attorney general was investigation a charity connected to the chamber for illegal donations.not the rules we wish we had'the role of super pass was seen in the bitterly contested republican primary battle this spring.candidates like former u.s. senator rich antrum and former house speaker new gingrich were able to keep their campaigns going, and keep as on the air, much longer with help from deep-pocket political sugar dandies: businessman foster friend and causing soul seldom elson, respectively.button said democrats, having surveyed the landscape, are warming to the fight.they are getting engaged at a much brisker pace than they were previously because if they dont, there will never be reform, said button. we go into this campaign season with the rules we have, not the rules we wish we had.guy cecil, who runs the democratic senatorial campaign committee, said his party was not going to unilateral diary and allow the other side to buy the election.while praising the quality of campaigns many democrats are running, i dont think that that message alone is strong enough to overcome $1 billion in spending.source: http://www.renters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-washington-summit-money-idusbre85q1sr20120627

3720,my 3 year old daughter has been toilet trained for over a year and has only every had a few accidents.    she took to the toilet really well and was trained within a few days. suddenly yesterday she begun to wee on the floor. she went in the bathroom and did it on the floor. she tried to clean it up by emptying a whole bottle of handwash and covering it with a towel. i ignored this just telling her that she shouldn have used all that hand soap and should have told mummy.she then continued to do it 3 times yesterday evening, once in the bathroom and once even walking right past the bathroom to go and do it in the playroom.    i feel this is definitely not due to problems with petty training or because she is not making it to the toilet on time as she is very good at holding it and have been for nearly a year and a half.we do have another baby on the way, and although we have tried very hard to be positive, i guess she could be anxious about it.    when i try to talk to her about it she says she is happy about baby coming and excited, but she is only 3.foi she is a good girl and says sorry as soon as i see the see.    she is very sensitive to peoples feelings and doesn normally do much attention seeking.please help!

3727,the supreme court will hear oral arguments tuesday in fishes v. university of texas, the court  s first case on the use of race in higher education admission since its decision in grate v. bollinger and gutter v. bollinger.nail period of the u.s. commission on civil rights says new research indicates that race-deferential admission to america  s top universities are hurting those they are supposed to help.  if this research is right, we now have fewer minority science and engineering graduates than we would have under race neutral admission policies,   period said in an amiss brief filed along with fellow commissioners peter kirsanow and told gazing.  we have fewer minority college professors .  .  . fewer minority lawyers too.  on the other hand, the american educational research association says it isn  t so.   research continues to show that student body diversity leads to important educational benefits,   the group, along with other research associations, said in its amiss brief to the court.the supreme court has received 92   friend of the court   briefs filed in fishes v. university of texas, which it will hear tuesday, seventy three on behalf of ut and the rest supporting fishes or in opposition to affirmative action. the point of these briefs is to inform the justices of the consequences.abigail noel fishes, who is white, says she was denied admission to ut in 2008 while the university  s policy resulted in african american and hispanic students with lesser credentials being admitted.ut says race is just one of many characteristics it considers in a   politic   review of some applicant to build a diverse class, as governed by past supreme court decisions.  the amiss briefs explain to the court the importance of what the decision means to everyone else. in this case, not just the 50,000 students at ut,   but to students in universities across the country, said lisa s. platt, an attorney who has appeared frequently before the supreme court.abigail thernstrom, another civil rights commission member, says affirmative action undermine race relations   by frightening stereotyped and creating greater separation and self-aggregation between racial groups.  she adds that the references create disincentives for black and hispanic students to work hard and they increase those students     self-doubts about their abilities to succeed academically.  uncle law professor richard wander, and journalist stuart taylor jr. in a new book and in a brief to the court, say there are wide academic gaps between minority students admitted because of their race and their fellow students, and lead to lower grades and granulation rates and cause some students to switch to less-challenging major.http://www.examiner.com/article/u-s-supreme-court-to-decide-the-fate-of-affirmative-action

3739,my daughter is five, sheds in preschool for a speech delay, that almost gone. at the last parent meeting the teachers brought up some issues that i dont really think are a problem. when its time for stations, if my daughter wants to do a certain one, but they want her to do a different one first she gets upset. or when sheds in speech and there playing a game, once her turn is over she kind turns and finds something else to do till it is her turn again. sheds not hyper active or anything like that, i just think its her personality. i also think maybe its just that sheds five. i dont have a huge problem with her at home, the biggest thing is we cut sugar, cause that makes her a little crazy. any advice, or thoughts would be helpful. just kind want to know if anyone else five year old is kind the same.
3740,every action a person takes in the united states is regulated by the government. many of these regulations go unnoticed. but think about every action you take and the bureau-   cry tic agency regulating it. from brushing your teeth to watering your lawn, the government has intruder and regulated every action you take. but how did we end up in a society that has allowed itself to be regulated across the board?we live in an age where the government fears the people. and frightfully so. they rustle our paychecks, ballot combine corporations against the wishes of the public, and send our money overseas to painless causes. clearly, this government has taken many actions that are not supported by the people that pay for them.many people argue that we are rewarded richly for government differing via public schools, defense and road systems, to name just a few government projects. but many of these services, if not all, could be provided with better quality and cheaper prices through the private sector.which leads one to wonder why we never hear privatization advocated by our politicians? why should people always look to government for solutions to modern day problems such as the by spill clean, instead of private companies that could do the same work better and cheaper?wise economists from the austrian school of thought blame this blind support of government intervention on a phenomenon known as   the people  s romance.   this phenomenon shows people are drawn to government in a way that allows government to take actions most would object to if they understood what truly free society is. if the average citizen was to closely examine the complete control government wields over one  s life, investigation the effects of each nancy state regulation, they would most likely object to the power government has.through   the people  s romance,   the government consolidated power by controlling local points in one  s life. people become dependent, so they think, on the plethoric of government services that are provided. government officials exploit the services to win support in elections. most politicians argue expanding certain services to further consolidate power, but rarely do we see a politician argue privatization of these services. to private would mean that the government would lose access to influence every facet of your life.currently,   the people  s romance   is on the rise in america. with the drama administration  s expansion of power through insane amounts of frivolous spending via   the stimulus   and the complete takeover of the health care sector, government influence over one  s life seems to be the only thing growing in 2010. the government would rather hide the fact that they have mixed the economy through their incessant, destructive intervention then risk losing the ever-expanding control they wield over society.if we want a society that is free of an encroaching government that impedes individual freedom, we must look to the private sector for answers to today  s problems not to government bureaucratic interested in gaining more power. we must remember that only the private sector can deliver the results that government has prove time and again it is unable to do. and above all, the private sector removed bad business actors from the marketplace efficiently while government drops them up by failing them out with your money and the money of future generations.there is nothing wrong with supporting government. but there is something very wrong with a government that wants to regulate your every action. don  t let your romantic feelings of government cloud your lens of viewing what congress and drama are really after.adam likely is the editor-in-chief of netrightdaily.com.http://www.papa.com/opinion/action-49672-every-government.html

3743,i have a big problem on my hands here. i have a blood phobia. when i see or even think about blood,i get very sick and almost pass out. this has prevented me from seeing a dentist and i have a very bad tooth abscess right now. my left lower nine tooth has been hurting for a whole week now and today it was the worst. i have to take 1600 my of ibuprofen in 12 hours and then i take 1000 my of tylenol just to numb the pain somewhat. this has been causing side effects..my stomach is upset and i noticed that my urine was green several times. but i dont know what to do about this pain. if i was not afraid of blood,i would go to the dentist and get this tooth out but i would never be able to do it..even if i did it under sedition,there is still bleeding afterward and i would not be able to handle that.so,can anyone here tell me,what are my option? i am a 28 year old male with some heart issues and this pain is causing very high blood pressure and i do not want to do damage to my heart.    thanks.
3744,i just returned from my month check-up.i have had 3 forgeries,the last being with the silicone oil. my vision has not been restored and now the dr. says it will not get better. i am thinking of going to mayo clinic.looking for some advice ,
3745,what does this mean?    my dr. writes in his notes that we discussed molecular precautions in all of my appointments, and we dont!    i always mean to ask him, but hers in and out of there so fast i dont get the chance!
3746,recently had ultrasound. during the ultrasound i was told my uterus was very large about 25 cm. they couldn see the varies. there was something most likely fibroid and its size was close to 13 cm. do you know what would be the next step that would be taken in such situations? what would be the available option for me. i would like to have kiss. ism 37 right now. i already researches online and looked at all the treatment option. i know some of the option will lower fertility rate or diminish it completely. please advise. the technical said the uterus was so large she couldn see the varies and she could measure something that was 13 cm and there could be more smaller ones. from my understanding with large fibroids the best thing is to do an mr to see the exact locations and how many there are plus everything will show up in mr including varies as well as whether the problem is fibroids or adenomyosis (also whether there are cancerous findings). i dont have heavy bleeding, just longer periods (light after a few days, but lasts long), & frequent privation.
3747,apparently, this 18-year-old boy was dating a 16-year-old, which is still legal. she sent some rude pictures to his email as a surprise. after an argument, late one night, he got vindictive and sent some of the pictures to the contact on her email address. the next day, police showed up and confiscated everything digital that he owned and arrested him. he is now labelled a sex offender, and will be 43 before he can approach the courts about repeating the felony charge and title.mio, this is ridiculous. he was a jerk, absolutely, but this goes overboard, way above and beyond what he should have been charged with. this setting (taking rude pictures of oneself and using digital media such as phone or email to send the image to others) is out of control, first of all, but to charge someone that i still consider on the edge of childhood as a sex offender over something so very small? i find it absolutely ridiculous. obviously he was an adult and should be punished legally for doing something he had no business doing, morally or legally, but to carry the felony title of sex offender for more than 20 years? i canst even fathom how this is proportional to the crime. he also has to attended mandatory therapy once a week, discussing such issues as why rape is wrong and what sexual abuse does to the victim. this seems wrong to me, and everyone here knows that i have no tolerable for sexual predator...but i dont see this guy as being that bad.
3748,i had to have a root canal december 4, 2007 for a tooth which had a very large filling in it.    after the dentist gave me an injection of novocaine, i have no feeling in the tip of my tongue and along the right side of my tongue.    i am afraid i will never regain the sensation in my tongue again.    can you tell me if this is normal, and if so, how long it will take for the feeling to return?    ism thinking my dentist did something wrong to cause this, although he is adamant that he did not.    i have more dental work that needs to be done, but am afraid to continue.    i have had numerous filling, two previous root canals, and have never had this experience before.    please help me find some answers.

3757,ism really hoping someone can advise me..the main problem is i am british but live in france and my french isn up to quizzing days on benefits of various vols and i will need one soon - i dont want to make massive mistake or miss out because i am not aware of all option . ism female and just 36 years old.i have small posterior subcapsular attracts and myoma of -9 left eye, -10 right eye. i have moderate to terrible flowers in right eye (have reached tapping point where vitrectomy might be only option) - very mild flowers in left eye which, if they didn worse, i could quite happily live with forever and no way would i risk a vitrectomy for. apparently my retina is amazingly good for a high more (not sure if that important - but hey, at least its a some good news!).i would like an ill in my right eye in the next few months - if i am honest, i must say i have a tiny secret hope it will positively affect flowers or the improvement in vision may retract from them . i feel left eye might be able to wait a couple of years or even more. is an accomodative lens out of the question for a patient of -10 bearing in mind i am in europe? i think by the time the left eye needs doing accomodative lenses for high hopes will be available and i feel that if i have among in one eye and an accomodative lens in the other i will feel balanced and perhaps suffer eye strain or headache.in hope!

3759,i am currently in the process of getting a court ordered visitation schedule with my ll ones father. he was mostly absent in his life for the first two years.    at almost age 2.5 he started requesting to spend time with him after the state became involved with child support. although the original motive might not have been great, it was a good thing for my ll one as he was finally spending time with his child. the problem now is that he is on a path to try to reduce support by going after 50/50 custody. and although i am very happy my ll one has finally gotten to know the other half of the family which included two step brothers. the transition has been really difficult. i allowed my self to get pushed into giving more visitation than i really felt was good for my ll one out of fear he would try to get joint. we currently have a thus - monday schedule 2 times with in the 2 week period of time he is home. (he works out of town for two weeks a month). by the end of this schedule its very emotional stressfful to my ll one.    on several instances has even repressed and had poor and see accidents. my ll one has been fully petty trained since age two. had a similar happening the first time i had to go out of state for training. that time my ll one was with their grandparents who have a very close relationship to my ll one. and even then around day 5 or so there was popping accidents.has anyone else seen these type of repression? are there ways to try and make the transition easier with less stress when the non primary parent isn easy to work with?
3760,i am probably going to cause a lot of sparks with my post, just trying to get a better idea of my option.okay, ism 22 years old living at home because of college and my father is an alcoholic. i never thought he was until after i graduated high school went to basic training and then came home to find my dad had really changed. we use to go to friends and drinks and that was always fun, never had a problem. over the last four years he has really gone downhill, he makes no sense, comes home drunk and finds anything and everything to complain about and is even getting forgetful, not to mention hers always complaining of some type of stomach problem and he looks pregnant (famous beer belly). the thing is he is in strong denial and has adapted a morning dependency not just beer like bloody mary and d. there is no talking to    him anymore. my father and i use to be really close and after he came home drunk and criticized everything about me and acts like the world is out to get him i just canst hold a conversation with him anymore and its really harmful. if i try to talk to him about it sober or not he turns it around to saying i really hurt his feelings. its been like that for almost years now.the situation has yet worse. my mother is completely against drinking and of course my father hides it, until he come home and canst hide it and then it usually turns into a big blow out. well, back in november i was pulled over and had been drinking, yes of course i was arrested for a due. i want drunk but had enough in me, ( i was pulled over for not having my lights on, something i always do) i was out and just wanted to go home and go to bed, i should've just waited another half an hour and i woudn't be in the situation i am now. not point into going into that i made a bad choice and i have accepted the consequences.i thought my mon was going to freak out on me, she didn. she has of course said you've done this to yourself....but i know you dont have a problem and dont drink that much unlike your father, you'll get through this just fine. coming from my mon this really shocked me. i have found out that she was hoping my situation would help my father realize how easy it is even when you are attempting to me (somewhat) responsible and careful. it has not and instead my fathers drinking of course has only gotten worse. after he picked me up, i asked him if he was disappointed,    i was told no, things happen. what!?! i mean granted anything anyone can say to me can not amount to the disappointment i have in myself but still, agent parents suppose to say something?i am not sure what my real issue is with all of this. i have been court order to go through a few classes and be on probation. ( i have no counselling and am not interested in seeking any for personal reasons) the classes really opened my eyes and the whole time the only thing i could think of was my dad and how his alcoholism has affected us. he told my mon that he knows who started me drinking, i never drank regularly until i started drinking with him ( she does not know this, and i want to save her the pain of that) after it first happened he was all about helping me out and everything, i stuck to it that i did this to myself and will make it through it on my own. i of course losses my license for a time period and that has been the only time i have gone to anyone for help, transportation to work and classes. my dad has gone to my mon saying have asked him for money and how he refused to give it to me, this never happened and never will.i know ism at risk for alcoholism because of my father and have always known that and everything that has happened up to this point has really enforced my want to not turn out like that. i am disguised with myself and yes i do kind of blame him little bit and know he feels guilty but i find i am more disguised in him. sometimes i wish probation would come and check on me when his in one of his drunken ranks so he could be right where i am and maybe some type of intervention would be to save his health and his family.my mother and i talk more now about his situation and the affects of it. as much as my dad thinks that i am depends on my parents my mon sees that i am not that and that i working really hard. i graduated college in june, have been working the same job for almost years, am starting to look for another part job and as it is looking i will be released from being monitor by the court system early. stuff is really going to get deep after i graduate in june and when the cold hard fact of me moving becomes a reality whether it be earlier then planned or in the fall. i feel that the only way to break away from all of this is to walk away and never look back, i really do not want to do that but i canst see it any other way. suggestion, advice and opinions or any similar situations?

3764,metal theft is not a new phenomenon in the u.s., nor is it a surprising one given the state of the economy. but a thief or group of thieves in north beaver township, pennsylvania, has raised the bar by stealing a 50-foot-long by 20-foot-wide bridge for scrap metal, according to pennsylvania state police.authorities say the privately owned covers crossing bridge, which was made of corrupted steel, has been valued at approximately $100,000 and was dismantled using a blowtorch sometime between september 27 and october 5. the pittsburgh tribune-review reports that it contained a steel web dealing along with steel i-beam supports.  its old i-beams are probably hundreds and hundreds of pounds per foot,   nearby resident robert bed told can affiliated the-to in pittsburgh.   it  s an old railroad bridge.  covers crossing is in a remote wooded area of the rural township, which is home to 4,000 people about 50 miles north of pittsburgh. the bridge had been around since the early 1900s and was owned by new castle development, who told the pittsburgh post-gazette that the company had recently closed off public access to the crossing because of reports of copper theft in the area. company spokesman mary bruce said that bridge was primarily used by a nearby business to transport materials, but there is an alternative route that is still accessible.bridge theft, while certainly rare, is not unheard of. in 2008, a group of russian thieves managed to dismantled and haul off a 200-ton, 38-foot steel bridge in just one night, according to a report from britain daily mail.source:http://news.blows.can.com/2011/10/07/thieves-dismantled-cart-off-steel-bridge-in-pennsylvania/?hot=us_c2
3765,hi, my boyfriend and i are both turning 18 closer to the end of the year, we have been together for 25 months now and have been having sex for roughly 1 year and a half. everything has always been fine everytime, even the first time, which was the first time for both of us, went perfectly, i bled a little bit but not much at all. but the last two times we had sex, i was bleeding a little bit afterwards, not heavy and not for long, but it still makes me worry. he thinks i should go to the doctors about it, but the doctors i go to are of a different race and are very strict about no sex until after marriage, so i know i wouldn feel comfortable talking to them about it, and my sum and i agent that close, so that leaves me with no one else to talk to about it.. can someone please help me? if its serious, or could be, i want to know as soon as possible so i can do something about it quicker.
3766,my 9 year old son had some dental work done today.    he had 5 filling on one side of his mouth.    they used fibrous oxide and said that he should be totally relaxed and do just fine.    3 of my other children have had fibrous oxide for filling and did just fine.    however my son today vomited during the procedure.    which they immediately extracted with their suction.    they said that this does happen some times.    in looking this over at information online, i have seen it say that this occurs when over sedition occurs.    my son remembers that he vomited, but what seems to bother him most is he said he was so dizzy and felt like he was spinning the whole time.    and that he was in a enclosed small space the whole time.    so ism assuming he was claustrophobic.    he has to go back to get a few more filling, and ism wondering if he should not have the fibrous oxide?    has anyone out there ever experienced vomiting during the procedure when having the laughing gas?    my other concern is if he doesn have it, and he starts to gag or vomit that hell freak out if he isn lightly seated.    i know from watching it, it was so scar to see him lying there vomiting, and not being able to do anything to help him, other than comforting him.    any advice would greatly be appreciated.    thank you!

3771,http://www.radaronline.com/exclusive/2012/09/chef-allegedly-cooked-wife-four-days los angeles-area chef currently on trial for the murder of his wife told police that he used his professional skill in the kitchen to dispose of the body by slow-cooking her remains for four days.david viens, of limit, calf., finally revealed the gruesome truth to sheriff investigator who had been searching for his wife, dawn, 39, following her disappearance on october 18, 2009, reported the los angeles times.i just slowly cooked it and i ended up cooking her for four days, revealed viens in a tapped confession from march 2011 describing the grimly disposal of the body in a 55-gallon drum, which was played for rumors tuesday. i manipulated her so the face was down, and i took some - some things - like weights that we use, and i put them on the top of her body.i just slowly cooked it and i ended up cooking her for four days. i let her cool. i strained it out.when asked by sat. richard fascia what trigger the vicious attack, 49-year-old viens replied: for some reason i just got violent, because his wife had been raising hell in their apartment and he just wanted to sleep, he then went on to explain how he bound her hands and feet and duct-tapped her mouth. and that was it. i said, good night.viens told police that he had previously tapped her up to prevent her from driving around wasted, hacked out on come and drinking.when he woke up in a panic the next morning and realized what he had done, the urinary expert came up with the idea of getting rid of her body in the heavy duty equipment to collect used cooking grease and oil, which is later sucked out by a disposal company.after pouring seven or eight pounds of grease from the drum into his grease trap using a trash bag, the murder suspect told detective that he took his wife skull and jaw in one piece and hid it in the attic of his mothers trance home. the rest of the remains were placed in trash bags and he buried them in the trash can behind his restaurant.viens has not revealed exactly where the cold-hearted act took place, but it has been implied it was at the theme cafe restaurant in limit, between trance and san per in los angeles county.the graphics confession was made while viens was hospitalized after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in palms verses in a suspected suicide attempt, but he has since pleaded not guilty to his wife murder. he was so severely severely injured in the jump that he is attending his murder trial in a wheelchair.
3772,i recently got engaged to my boyfriend who i have been dating for almost 3 years now. we are getting married in 2 months   time. everything was going well and i was busy shopping and preparing for the big day! i travelled to another town for shopping with my mon over the weekend. i needed to get back for work on monday while mon was donna stay longer. my fiance  did not want me to travel alone as he is very protective about me.    so i lied to him saying i had a friend coming with me. the lie was very trivial and only so that he does not worry too much about me. however he knows me in and out. and figured by the way i was talking that there was something fish. so i accepted that i lied and told him everything. this has hurt him a lot as he trusted me blandly and changed the way he looks at me. he doesn  t want to trust me anymore and does not care. (at least he says so) he has a tendency of saying mean things to make me realize my mistakes. he is also fed up of giving me chances as i have been and done stupid things in the past. this situation has screwed up any excitement regarding the wedding. i desperately want things to be ok. but i know that it ll take time. how can i handle this situation in the best way. i ve already apologized and promised that i would never lie again.

3791,http://news.yakov.com/connecticut-survivor-attend-school-neighboring-town-155145415.htmlnewtown, connecticut (renters) - the children who survived friday shooting at sandy hook elementary school will not have to return to the scene of the massacre when school ropes later this week and instead will attend classes in a neighboring connecticut town, newtown school officials said on sunday.it remains unclear when the 436 surviving students at sandy hook will return to class, but when they do it will be in an unused school about 7 miles to the south in monroe, newtown school superintendent janet robinson said.the town of monroe has graciously offered their chalk hill school, robinson said in a statement. this facility, which is currently not being used, is in excellent condition and will accommodate all of the sandy hill school students and staff.it is located just across the border from newtown and should be ready for occupancy in just a few days.all seven of newtown public schools, which serve more than 5,100 students, as well as private schools in the district, will be closed on monday, school officials said late on saturday.officials were crumbling for ways to accommodate surviving students from what had been the towns largest elementary school, serving 5- to 10-year-old in kindergarten through fourth grade. the public school remains an active crime scene.a newtown police officer expressed doubt the school could ever be used again.at this time its too early to say. but i would find it very difficult for them to do that. certainly that one of the things there going to have to look into, lieutenant george sink of the newtown police said at a news conference on sunday.

3793,madison, wisconsin.    does anyone remember the historic 2006 elections where americans finally sent a slate of legislators to washington to put the rakes on the radical extremist policies and war-machine of george w. bush (and remember, w stood for herbert walker -- this does matter).    just before that historic election, karl love told nor that, despite polling data to the contrary, he had the path and that no meaningful change would happen.    what was he actually stating?last week, a video showed up on couture -- a shot across the bow to highly-placed political insider:    anonymous warns karl love not to do it this time (h/t mark crisis miller).    after the jump, we will share this short video (1 min 37 see).voices has inside information, direct from the source, that a statistical significant and definite report will be released this week that will clearly demonstrate how official election results are not legitimate.    we have been told directly that the report is being released in the hope that, by identifying how honest and accurate vote counts are undermined -- karl love (and others) will have to ditch a plan to steal the november 2012 elections.it appears the activist group anonymous is also working to send love and company the same message:anonymous is watching and will not stand down if karl love and his crossroads pay overthrow our government by stealing the 2012 election.     love has taken steps to ensure that americans believe this election is a close race -- too close to call.this provides cover to step in and fig the numbers to elect mist money and proclaim that, because it was a tight race, rovers candidate was able to squeaky through a close election.if love believes this -- he is making a mistake.    anonymous is watching closely and collecting highly technical data which, should the fix be in, be turned over to authorities in the hopes that love will be prosecuted to the full-extent of the law.highly qualified and talented echoes are monitoring key serves and internet traffic on each of these serves for anything suspicious -- love will not get away with any fraud without appropriate consequences.it will be best for karl love, any co-conspirators, and america, for them not to even try to temper with honest election results.http://voicesnewspaper.blogspot.com/2012/10/anonymous-warns-karl-love-not-to-do-it.html to view the video

3803,i have been with my boyfriend for 4 1/2 yes and i have noticed last march( during a exam) that i am starting to bleed slightly after we have sex. i am quite shock b/c we have been together for so long and this has never happened! we are trying to conceive a child, but with me bleeding i know this is a very bad sign! i also know that i probably wont be able to get pregnant! what can/should i do?
3804,my daughter has always had anger issues, settled down more so now. however she has outbursts now and again which can go on because she cannot calm herself down, she would shout at me or anyone else who intervened, slam doors, scream, end up almost being sick with temper.    i have tried different methods on dealing with this, now she seems to make personal oral attacks on her younger step brother who has a few personal issues, although she does not necessarily mean what she says to him she does so during a falling out between them.    she is well behaved otherwise and intelligent and excellent reports from school etc.     she is very much a thinker and i feel that she makes herself worse by think over issues or life in itself too much.    this is now affecting both her step brothers and step father.    she has always had a good life and has no reason to hate her life.
3805,my son will be six on the with of this month and has recently started kindergarten. the kindergarten experience has turned into a nightmare for me. we cannot go a day without a negative report from his teacher - he refuses to listen, disrupt the class, takes down things hanging on walls, bulletin boards, etc.., and has just yesterday cut a classmates hair. each night we discuss with him what is expected of him at school, the importance of respect and take away privileges when he comes home with a negative report. so far, nothing has seemed to work. his response is always its too hard to make good decisions. i am at my wits end. i dont know what else to do. ism not even sure where i have gone wrong. i am completely overwhelmed. i need some advice. thank you.
3806,my son started about two months ago having extreme anxiety over sleeping, refusing to sleeping his room and keeps up for hours until we end up bringing him in the living room with us, this was sudden onset and awful for all of us, he has always had symptoms of add but he was a sweet and smart boy so we just tried to deal with it, we did not want him on meditations, within the past couple of months he has lost friends at school due to his behavior and his teacher and school forced us to get him on meditation, concert 18mg, since starting things seem to be worse including his sleep, i don;t want him dedicated day and night, what eyes can we do? is this not add? we have an appointment with a behavior specialist next week but i feel so lost for him and frustrated, help!!!
3807,my son is now 3 years old-but after reading some of the topics on here-i thought i should ask about some things that have concerned me. for about the last year-he has been very interested in his genital area. he plays with himself many times-almost every time he is in the tub or in the shower or naked daytime. it has gotten so bad a few times that i noticed noise coming from him as if going in to full pleasure with the situation. i am concerned about the behavior and where at 2 years old he could have discovered this, learned this or whatever. coming from a sexually abusive home myself-i am very keen on anything sexual like this that it literally scars me to death that i perhaps failed as a parent and exposed either one of my children (i have a 7 year old daughter too) to something so horrible.my question is--at what age is this type of touching normal? can it happen at any age? and how do you determine if there is any other underlying issue when he child is so young? he talks very well--but i have chatted with him briefly without bringing too much attention into the matter--but he says he learned it nowhere.my biggest goal here is to make sure my kiss are safe. i would like to know what to look out for and perhaps gather some assurance to the situation--or information to make me take action.any advice would be great.thanks.

3811,my daughter is almost 4. she is always on the go. she gets hurt all the time from not slowing down. i am always telling her to calm down or slow down. i give her time out and take toys away, but this does not seem to help. i cannot seem to keep a sister for her. every time she goes to a sister after a couple weeks they tell me they can not watch her anymore because they cannot handle her. she does a lot of screaming, climbing, throws anything she can get her hands on, hurts other people, will not walk (runs everywhere), and gets into everything she possibly can. i stopped giving her caps, hoping this would take some of her energy away. it did not. it is very difficult to get her to settle down enough to get her asleep every night. last year she pulled a 250 pound electric fireplace over on herself, crushing her face and back of her skull. she was playing in the middle of the living room, i left her with my 8 year-old son and my boyfriend 11 year-old son long enough to lip sausage i was cooking for breakfast. i heard a loud crash and the boys scream. i ran into the living room finding her pinned under the fireplace. i do not want her to keep getting hurt. when she hurt on a daily basis. i am afraid she will get hurt really bad or worse. most of the she hurts her head or back. she will be starting preschool in august. i do not know what to do to calm her down. please help me. does anyone know what i can do?

3818,my son was diagnosed with pddnos at 5, then add at 7, then back to pddnos with add as a morbid condition at 10 years. he has been having seizures since he was 3. he has    speech/language delay, poor attention, poor social thinking and limited interests and he struggles with reading.         he is better at path. he simply canst plan and start a project, remember the details and complete the task. he is in a partially mainstream special education program.    he is 10 years old now. he has had 3 grandmals so far and about 2-3 complex partial seizure episodes per year.he    has taken in tests at 5 years and at 7 years    from the school and from neuropsycologists. all 4 tests revealed    below average - range ( around 87 ) for intelligence and mild impairment for executive/cognitive skill.he did pretty well in school for the last two years. he was bright and happy to participate. he had started blooming really well. his beds were changed in april to get better seizure control. we got seizure control but the side effects were bad. it feels as if his and and add issues have worsted.    the school year had barely started, they administered a series of tests including kaufman assessment battery for children - and edition.first of all, it takes him 15 minutes to just sit and start working on a problem he knows how to do. it takes him a lot more time to warm up to a new predictable situation    and give his undivided attention. on top of it, he is not good at responding to    open ended questions due to his communication problems.     he is better at multiple choice questions and visual questions.when i expressed all these concerns, the district said it was just a routine test.anyway, they say that his in has dropped to 60.    the only thing that has changed since the last test was that     he was hospitalized from a grand mal    2 years back, which was treated immediately and no long-term issues cropped up from that. it was confirmed by a series of medical tests.i have 3 questions. 1. given the    list of issues (attention, language, and and low motivation) my son has, has the school administered the    right in test ?    2. can in drop so significantly?     3. are there alternate in tests for kiss with and and add?also, should i just take the in test results with a grain of salt and continue working with him as usual? my only worry is that his already low bar at school will be lowered even more. his teacher has already stopped sending him to science and art classes because he canst handle them. he had started enjoying learning about sea animals. she just wants to work on his reading and path goals.sorry about the lengthy post.
3819,my son (uhlan)is 4 years + and goes to nursery school now.    he has been in the play school previously for seven months.    while the play school teachers gave feed back that be talks very less now for some times i have notices that he does not speak to anybody other than family members.    when checked with the present school the teacher as well as principal told me that uhlan does not talk to anybody and he gives very short, to the point, answers to the questions. i fear whether he is having selective cutis problem.    other wise he is above average intelligent.    he has a very good vocabulary.    he speaks very well can pronounce each and every word clearly.    in fact when he was only two he was able to speak more than 1000 words.    i dont know what should i do right now.    everything else is quite normal.    his motor skill are quite good. sleeps well eats well not bad habits etc.please help me.
3820,my grand daughter who is    4 year old, do not show any interest or whatsoever to take food or milk right from the early days. her parents try to feed her with great effort but the child doesn cooperate. the attending doctor says that there is no problem with the child as long as she is active. the child is very active and hale , but very lean.hardly she eats 4 to 5 spoons of food and a half glass of milk. that    all.not more than that. please advise us how to turn the mind of the child to eat properly the food    and drink milk regularly.
3821,my daughter is in her third year of school (and grade) & we have received the same complaint from each teacher.    she is easily frustrated & subjects or problems which she may have been doing with ease for weeks can, on any given day, become a crisis.    upon losing a problem (new or old) she will instantaneously cry out i canst do it!, bury her head in her hands, & either cry, groan, stop her feet, or throw herself on the floor (yes, even in the middle of her peers in the school room).    we, & the teachers, both agree she is a very bright girl & can do the hardest problems with ease when she isn disposed to these fits.    unfortunately, these outbursts seem to be increasing in frequency.    we moved from the u.s. to europe in sept 2006 immersing her in a dutch school adding stress & pressure, and although they have increased recently sheds portray this behavior from very early in life.    (foi: she is now client, speaking & reading in both languages; the teacher admits better than most natives in her class.)    she has always had a tendency to want to do things perfect the first time and would rather stand at the back of her ballet class to watch the rest of the girls until the third - last class when she could join the dance with perfect choreography.    she is normally happy & pronounced bright & social by most, but anyone who tries to teach her something school related or otherwise will see her shut down followed by some temper antrum.    her teachers & parents are finally at their wits end.    weave both tried all spectrum from being overlay sweet and understanding to getting angry and forcing her to do the problem.    neither of these, nor anything in between have unlocked her brain or pulled her back to reason during these daily moments.what is this and how can we work her through it?
3822,my almost 5 year old daughter has informed me several times, the most recent time yesterday that she hears voices talking quietly in her head.    this last voice she explained was while she was at preschool and it quietly said, stupid.     i think previously it has said things like, spongebob or maybe sang a familiar song.i know it sounds silly... but she very clearly described the voice as coming from her own head.    i have three children a 4 year old, her (5 years old) and a 7 year old.    all girls.    all very different.     ism a single parent and have absolutely no experience with anything like this.. i dont really know what to tell her...like i said, she brought it up recently like she was a little worried.    i didn know what to say.    i told her i believed her and asked her if she recognized the voice and asked her if maybe she was thinking the words so much that she kept thinking them and couldn get them out of her head... and she said, no mummy....    its like the voice is in my head    i told he to let me know if she hears the voices again.she will be 5 in july.    should i take her somewhere?    i mean, do i ask her every day if she heard any voices in her head today?    do i ignore it until she brings it up again? what is normal?
3823,we ended up pulling our did from her school instead of fighting it out for 8 weeks. we felt that someone had to end the drama so it might as well be us. my mon said that they probably have to say they are willing to accept special needs children so that they will not lose their federal funding; even if they are not actually equipped to deal with all types of children. we have lots of exciting plans for her after we move. have already spoken to a couple potential schools and found one that we think would suit her really well. i can only work in the evenings now when my do is home. i dont get to see him as much as ind like, but its not permanent.
3824,hi i wanted to know if its normal that my child didn decide with hand to write with left or right he is almost 5 years he is finding problems in school because of that ?

3832,my granddaughter is 4 and very smart.    it seems that she can be sweet part of the time and then can just fly off the handle.    my son and his wife have tried different types of discipline, but are at their wits end.    she seems to direct her crying and hitting more at her mon who has become depressed over the situation.    and she knows that she has been bad.    i have noticed when asked for huge and kisses when we say good bye that she very seldom gives us one and it is not just us.    she has a 4 year old cousin who is small for his age and she can play nice with him, but at times will act more like a mother to him.    this has been going on for about the past year.    any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

3835,my son is 4.5 years old. he has been petty trained for one year doing #1. however, for some reason he cannot seem to do #2. he doesn understand the concept of pushing the poor out and i simply do not know how to explain it to him. he does go, but since he doesn know how to push it out, the only time he goes is when he is so overfilled that he has no choice but to let it out and then, he tries to hold it in. i am totally at a loss on what to do.    he has been sitting on the petty today for almost 8 hours trying to poor and i keep thinking that this canst be right. but i dont know what to do, when i take him off the petty and try to wipe him up, i can see the poor still coming out so i put him back on the petty to finish and it is now a recurrent cycle. ever since i can remember he has had problems with constipation. i give him baby laxatives and raisins to loose up his stools but they dont seem to do much good. he has to start kindergarten soon and i am afraid he will be that one child who goes to kindergarten in papers.    he has already been expelled from pre-kindergarten.    what do i do or say to this child to get him to understand how to push the poor out?    he is my third child, so i have done the petty training thing before but for some reason he just does not want to do it. i have talked to my doctor and their response is hers just not ready. i find that hard to believe because he says that he wants to go on the petty but then after a few days in underwear and his first accident, he gets discouraged and revert back to pull up.    could this be a medical problem?

3838,my 6 year old son is a normal healthy boy.he is quite friendly and very loyal in his friendships.problem is that he quite often feels that children doesn like him and dont want to be friends with him although i dont seem to analyse any reason for it.he likes to be friends with more outdoing and sport boys but when he befriend them he tends to become a follower doing just as they instruct and it does occur to me that he is lacking leadership qualities.sometimes,he may be more capable but he takes a backseat with his dominating friends just so that they still remain friends with him.a boy whom he considers his best friend and really likes is very dominating and makes him follow him.when they 2 are alone hell be playing with him but as soon as a third boy comes along he ignores my son and starts playing with him.i realize my son feels deeply hurt by his attitude.if my son tries to make new friend that best friend of him doesn let him do that.it seems my son is resorted by him that he is not ready to listen anything against him and it truly breaks our heart to see that boy hurting my son every time.he doesn say anything to us but sometimes i find him sitting alone depressed.what should we do?? please help

3840,i have large ankles and would be interested in surgery to escape them so i could feel confident to go to swimming pool
3841,i am having a difficult time with my 7-year old.    he is in and grade and has been in 2 different schools.    the one that he attended as a kindergartner closed at the end of that year.    we chose to go to another small school similar to what he was used to.    we fought every morning for him to go into the school.    i would have to drag him kicking and crying into the school to his classroom and if i didn sit with him for a little while, he would get extremely upset.    the teacher would literally have to pull him off of me so that i could leave.    as soon as i was gone, he was fine.    we dealt with all of that to come to a student/teacher conflict.    being in a new school system, we weren aware of all the little things that make school life work.    this teacher, as we found out, want the best at making life in the classroom easy.    anyway...and grade started out great and he doesn have a problem after the first day when the teacher politely informed him that it was his job to get out of the car and come into class without his mon and that i shouldn have to walk him in.    he would be just fine and has been.    she is a fantastic teacher.ok with all of that...here is the problem.he struggled a lot with doing homework and reading last year.    to the tune of being about 3 months behind in his reading series.    this year he has a terrible time concentrating on his work and it is still very hard to make him do his homework at night.    he is so stubborn that it is like talking to a wall.    it doesn work to yell at him as he just shuts down when that happens.    i sit with him every night and what should only take him 15 minutes to do usually takes 30.    the teacher has talked to me about holding him back as he is the youngest in his class and at least one of the students (there are only 14 in the class) is about 15 months older than he is.    he has a horrible time staying focused.    he knows how to do the work and when he is worked with one on one...he can read to the speck of an accelerated reader.    he can do his other work when he decides that he wants to do it.    he has been tested for special education and actually did some of the tests in half the time allowed.    his results soared.the teacher has discussed her thoughts on this and when i express my concern for holding him back she says that he has the potential to be a leader and knows the stuff.    he just doesn understand how to process all of that information in his head all the time.    she has worked many years with the rd grade teacher and neither of these teacher feel that he is ready to go into the rd grade.    the rd grade and the th grade are both the hardest grades.    just so much transition.    he uses big words and uses them correctly.    he has great problem-solving skill.    most of the time i figure it is stubbornness that is causing this problem, but i canst use that as an excuse for when he doesn do his homework.i know that i am the parent and that he should be doing what i say, but when it is a daily argument to do homework, you can only fight for so long before you are ready to give up yourself.i have until the end of march to decide what i want to do.    his father wont even discuss the needs of our son.i honestly dont know what to do.    if we hold him back then we take a chance on breaking down his self-esteem and causing confidence problems.    if we dont hold him back then we are going to have study problems forever.    there are many times when i canst sit down with him at night, if i dont do it, he doesn get it done.    just doesn seem to be a priority for his dad.    they dont want to fight with him as he just shuts down.i am looking for suggestions and thoughts...just need to make as accurate a decision as possible.thanks,
3842,i need help my 8 or old daughter has never wrote at school, i have had specialist and counsellor for her who all say she is fine, because she writes in front of them like any normal child.nothing has even happened at the school, she has been like it since she started, can anyone help me please.

3844,i have two children from a different marriage and i share custody with my husbands mon. she never follows the court order that is in place. i have filed contempt charges on her. every time i call my children my 10 year old daughter will not talk to me. she calls me a horrible mother and other ridiculous things. every time i go to see my children she will either not be there or tell me i should call before i come and will not let me take them. is there such a thing as brain washing a child because my daughter is acting like she dont even know lately like she could care less if i was even in her life.
3845,my 5 year old son just started kindergarden this year and is very smart but, seems to keep getting notes home or calls from the teacher about how he hits someone or throws rocks at recess and then lies about it blaming someone else. i have tried everything from rewarding him for the good behavior with trips to chuck cheese or a new toy. i always make a big deal of it when he gets all good marks for the day but nothing is working. he continues to do these things. he gets grounded from doing fun things like playing outside with the neighbor boys or going fun places or the to. at home he yells at me everytime he does not get his way and cry about everything unless it is what he wants. i have been trying to get him to talk to me about the way he is feeling by using words instead of throwing the fits. any ideas on what i can do to get him to change the way he is acting?

3849,my 5 year old just recently started undressing his friends. he had a play date with a 4 year old girl and while they were playing in her playroom he undressed her. when i found out (walked in on them) i was shocked, but then took him home and talked to him about other peoples privacy. we had talked before about his privacy, so i explained that just like we dont want other people looking at or touching his naked body he needed to follow the same rules for other people. he said he understood and i thought that was a lesson learned... until today. we were having another play date (with a different child, a boy this time) and my son was trying to coax him into taking his shirt off. the little boy came and asked him mon if it was okay cause my son said it was; she said no and the little boy ran back into the bedroom... knowing what had happened before i decided to go check on them and sure enough when i got to the doorway my son was still trying to convince him to do this. i called him into the bathroom and i reminded him what we had talked about before and then he got really mad at me and defensive. when we came out of the bathroom the other boy was upset and wanted to go home. i know it made the little boy uncomfortable, and frankly it makes me uncomfortable, but how do i make my son see that this is not an appropriate behavior?
3850,my four year old daughter has very recently (within the past few days) begun sobbing hysterical about how she rates our current house because it contains sharp knives and sharp scissors.    she asks me incessantly (i.e., every five minutes or so) when we can move out of the house and go to live at the lake.    she insists we will need to take everything from the current house except the bathtubs and toilets, because we will use the lake both as a toilet and a bathtubs.she has begun to refuse to use the bathroom, going so far as wetting herself when she could no longer hold it in and popping in her parts.    she claims that she is scared because the toilet might over flow if she uses too much toilet paper and has compromised by putting the paper in the trash can and refusing to flush.    she will additional concede to using her old baby petty.she recently revised her lake/house issue by saying we need to build a new house with new toilets.    she asks me, every five minutes why we have not left to build the new house.    when i explain we cannot afford to, it is too late, we need to talk to other people to get help with building, etc., she breaks down and begins sobbing.    i have attempted to distract her with the possibility of building a house out of blocks (too readable, she says) or drawing the house she imagines.    the drawing idea was useful, but she returned quickly to the demand that we must go start to build the new house.    even the act of drawing made her suddenly break down and start sobbing when i asked her what one particular squiggle was.    she explained later that it was a sign for katy's house and pointed to another sign on the other side that said katy's restaurant.i am puzzled by all of this.    her sister has just recently finished second grade.    my four year old will go to pre-school in the fall (which delights her).    she is strong-willed and often ports when she does not get her way, but the incoherent sobbing about a house seemed characteristic.her father and i are in the middle of a divorce.    i suspect that is part of it, but i dont know how or why (never took child psychology).    he has a female friend that the girls spend a great deal of time with (in fact, they spend more time doing things with him and his female friend than they do with him and me, though i do my best to spend as much time with them on the weekend and in the evenings as i can manage).the best i can come up with is that perhaps this is her brains way of coming with what is clearly a broken family.    maybe she imagines that, if she can build a new house and fix the things that are wrong, she will be able to fix her family too.if you have any ideas, please help.
3851,i have been with my husband for 23 years, and hers always drank too much. there for awhile so was i but i grew out of that, parting all the time.. but he still does it all of the time. now he is laid off and doesn have anything better to do with his time but drink with his brother or whoever is around to drink that day. i am so sick of it. i have left numerous times, and he ok for a little bit but then goes right back to it. he says he knows there is a problem but he wont do anything about it. he keeps saying hell stop, and never does. have hear that thousands of times now. my mon and dad are going crazy over this. they hate that i put up with it. i love him but i just dont know how much longer and can keep our family together. we have an 18 year old daughter. she knows how he is and says to me all the time, what are you doing with him? everybody tells me to get out while i still can. ism not getting any younger.what should i do? please help me.

3855,ism a stepmom to a child who is almost 10 years old.    my husband and i have been together for 8 years and married for 7.    i have known this boy since he was 2 years old.    we found out through a da test nearly 2 years ago that the child is not my husbands biological child.    my husband and i have two children together.    the biological mother has no other children.our situation is unique and i dont know anyone else to turn to.    quick history: after a nearly 3 year bitter custody battle, his mother won primary custody and we have visitation.    my husband has been there since day 1 and even after the da test, has continued to be there.    it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the visits because big mon always complicates things.    also, with him being the only child, he is spoiled rotten at his primary home and i get the feeling he expects a lot more from us (material wise) then he is getting.big mon & my husband were never married.    she is on her second long term relationship since their split and she is currently engaged.    the new boyfriend gives undivided attention to the child and they seem to have a good relationship (more friends than parent figure).    they are, by all means, a face little family.the biological father is out there and the big mon has pretty much refused to contact him. she feels that she should be able to pick and choose who is in her child life.    i believe that since she chose to sleep with him, at one point she must have thought he was ok!we are stuck.    we dont know what to do.    does this child continue on thinking we are his family, his flesh and blood--only to have this taken away from us on some whim by the unstable big mon?    do we tell him, at 10 years old that we love him and will be there for him but that he has another dad?    we have a custody order in place from the courts, but this will all change soon.    the big mon is going to have it withdrawn to reflect the current circumstances.any advice would be appreciated!!
3856,i have a four year old granddaughter that knows it is wrong to act out and will go along good for a short while and then all of a sudden she will tear up a room. she has been kicked out of two daycares and the public school say they do not have a program for her because she tested well on her screening and they cannot do anything until she is in kindergarden which is the next school term. we just do not know what to do. you say to her what are the rules and she will tell you no fighting no biting no kicking no screaming    and she will say that is a bad thing to do. drop her off at day care within the hour they are saying come back and pick her up. i know they are just doing their jobs but what are we supposed to. she is in consoling which yes not seem to be working because when she acts up she will say can i go back to see the lady and she is referring to the counselor. please help

3858,my 4 year old boy has had this behavior for over a year now, and while it my hope was that it was transient, as the behavior seemed to want over time, over the last week or so it has come back with a vengeance. at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, he will find a piece of food that to him looks like something, for example a gorilla chip that may incidentally have the silhouette of an animal. he will then demand to keep it, and will then show it away somewhere where it will invariably be forgotten. normally i would find this sort of thing cut and imaginative, however recently it has been nonstop, to the point that he will not eat as much as he should. he will simply see something he thinks is cut in his food and refuse to eat it.any intervention, such as taking the piece of food away will result in an epic antrum. if this were something we observed once in a while, we would likely think nothing of it. but it happens over and over and over throughout the day, to the point where we question the possibility of an obsessive disorder.as it happens, the onset of this more recent bout of antrum coincided roughly with us taking him off zyrtec, an clergy meditation, as i read that it could cause issues with kiss. he had been on it for months and months, every night, at the instruction of his allergist. he would still be taking it if i hadn done a bit of research about its possible negative pediatric side effects. it also coincided with his return to school, after winter break. before break started however, he had his hand broken by another kid at school, and had a cast, hand therapy, etc... the resultant drama at school was a bit much. if our child has obsessive issues coming from anxiety, then in sure all of this going on at his school didn help.we did have him evacuated over a year ago because of some attention issues at school, and ruled out things like cutis or asperger's at that time. their conclusion was that he has sensory issues, and as a result we had him in occupational therapy, which i am still somewhat confused about.anyway, while this post doesn really paint the whole picture, my hope is that someone out there recognizes might have some insight. does any of this sound normal? i think the best case scenario would be that he is a spirited child, has eccentricities, will grow up just fine, and were worrying way too much about it. that is my lunch, but just observing how little energy my wife has at the end of the day, i am concerned that there is something wrong. anyone?

3872,hello - i posted this question on the nutrition forum, but since this is a group all about my, i figured ind ask here too.    have been taking my citrate for a week now to try and reduce my premature ventricular contractions (pus).    i take a 200 my tablet in the morning and 1 top of natural calm at night.    i noticed right after i took my first dosage the first day that within a few hours of taking the my, i started to feel a weird internal-shaking feeling, almost like my inside were vibrating.    this has continued every day.    i only dont feel like this when i first wake up in the morning.    i know that my plays a big role in muscles, so is it possible that my body is just getting used to the my supplementation?    should i continue to take it and see if the sharpness subsides?    thank you!!
3873,earlier today i got my fly shot from the army national guard. tonight i noticed that when press into my shoulder at the location of the shot i can hear and feel a wrinkling that moves around under my skin. its almost as if there is air wrapped between my muscle and skin and i can move it around.what in the neck is going on here?
3874,i am going to abandon tonight for the first time in hopes that i can clear my mind, that i am in fact not going crazy.i have been enabling my husband for 4 years now.    it want until the past year that i have come to terms that my depression is related to watching him numb himself every night with 2 bottles of wine or equivalent of beer, and not being strong enough to tell him to stop. why? because when i do, he turns into a battle about every topic under the sun...then he takes off in the car and threatens to look for a place to live.last night i asked him why we have become so isolated from our friends and why our relationship is turning into roommates and not romantic partners, he shifts the blame on me. telling me i haven lost the baby fat after my pregnancy 2 years ago.    i am 115 pound 5'6 and my friends (the ones i still manage to keep) think if i get any sinner i will be anorexic.but i made a promise to him that if i run every day, i want him to stop drinking. he agreed for the most part minus weekend.he was doing ok the past few weeks, i would say a total of 5 days off and on without drinking. however, the other night he was vomiting profusely for hours. i told him it might be withdrawal and he shrugged it off as if i was crazy.last night was the last straw.    i have relatives coming into town, so i needed to take a day off from running, but i was still over exerting myself cleaning and painting while he watched. then he popped the bottle of wine and this feeling of betrayal came all over me. when i questioned why he was drinking, he said it was because i want running. there i was working my a*%^ off and he went outside to smoke and drink.i feel i have done way more than my share in this marriage..- financially suppurative..since i make a considerable amount more than him- responsible to pick up and drop off our baby - which makes my commune an hour long.- not to mention the daily tasks when i get home to clean, cook, and run the dog (that he wants nothing to do with).but, now i need me to be under 100 pounds for him to even notice me.why would he give up what i think is an amazing life for alcohol.     i always support him in all his other endeavors. he loved me for that at one time..now he just criticizes me if i dont agree with him.i told him i was going to abandon and his words were whatever.    i told him that i am tired of being angry and i am taking reposiblity for the mess i have put myself in, which is why i need abandon.i dont think he will respond...but i know he will start looking for a place. that is is defense...should i always be in fear of him leaving????    should i just let him drink and turn my eyes? hers fine unless i bother him about his drinking.

3877,hello, i have a question regarding hernia and the option available on behalf of my grandfather. hers been a huge part of my life and growing up (for my short 19 years) and after the loss of my grandmother due to what our family has come to as malpractice, i vowed never to let a family member or loved one go under the knife for any sort of procedure or operation without at least an ounce of understanding of what happening. i dont mean to come off offensively to anyone in particular, i am only asking these questions (and follow-up questions for clarity) for the sake of my grandfather and deciding what the best recourse of action is.currently my grandfather who is nearing 100 years of age has a hernia near his groin and has made 2 trips to the emergency room to massage it back in. he says that he nails in pain when the hernia pips out and is nearly immobile. apparently after having a long talk with my father, he has had this problem for about a year and has been pushing it off to see what it leads to. (regular check-up with doctors and all that) well now that the hernia has popped out 2 times in the course of 2 weeks, the family as a whole is weighing the option and it is tapping in favor of the operation now as a last resort.so here are the questions that are on my mind. (go figure, its 3:am and i have an examination at am)1) what are the risks involved in operating?2) what option are there for operating? i read of camera-guided needles to opening a 4 section to treat the hernia.3) what added risks or complications are there considering his age?4) what post-op risks are there) what are steps to help with recovery?6) are there any precautions to take prior to the procedure/operation? if so, what shall i ask of the doctor?thank you for reading and i truly appreciate any insight or help you can provide.
3878,i had a abdominal hysterctomy in november 2007 that left me with one ovary, since that time, i have severe mood swing every 28-30 days.    they are becoming increasingly worse each month.    i cry for no reason, accuse those around me of doing things i know (on a normal day) that they would never do.    i scream one minute, and sob uncontrollable the next.    i was recently forced to change doctors due to a change of insurance, this new physician states that one ovary is more than sufficient.    he checked my mormons during normal times, but refuses to check them during the rough days.    please help me, i feel like ism driving myself crazy and driving away those i love.thanks
3879,i have a    4 year old little boy who is very smart and has a good imagination. however, he typically throws a antrum in a store, dr. office, home, etc. he has problems with listening to me about picking up toys, manners, and not hitting and yelling. he will help with cleaning house shores except picking up his own toys. if i tell him to go to time out he will laugh and take off running. he also hits on me when he thinks    he is in the right. no matter what discipline action i take he never listens. when i tell him to not do something or to stop hitting on me or being destructive of other peoples stuff he laughs and keeps on doing it. i try time out holding him and keeping him there from 4 to 10 minutes and he just goes back to the same think right after time out. i have also tried spanning and it does not work either. he will be starting pre-k in the fall and i am scared they will kick him out do to his behavior. it is to the point that no one wants to babysit for me and it is hard to try to work a full time job and beg people to babysit. what can i do to get him in control? some people tell me it is just a toller for you it will get better the older he gets. but i am afraid that with the hitting and temper it could only get worse. should i speak to his pediatrician about the behavior or try something else. anyone with any advise please help i am ready to pull my hair out.

3893,i am at the end of my rope... our five year old son is a very bright and inquisitive child and generally very well behaved at home and in public but school has become a very different story.    hers currently in a pre-school/daycare program and will be starting a formal kindergarten program in two weeks.    for the last three weeks hers been having terrible antrum at school, tearing books, spitting in other sides meals, telling the teachers he gets beat at home and his parents dont care about him, etc.        my husband works out of state and is home only on weekend so ism sure that this situation, combined with the impending new school situation has him nervous.    weave talked with him, coaches him in strategics to constructive express anger, taken away privileges when he misbehaves, given him rewards when he acts appropriately... i dont know what else i can do.     he generally sleeps 10-11 hours per night, eats a well balanced diet and is given a lot of affection from both parents.    hers such a good child at home.    we are firm parents with good boundaries and clear expectations and antrum like the ones that occur at school almost never happen at home.    ism frightened that this will continue when he goes to real school and he will get labelled a troublemaker or bad kid.help?-erie
3894,i was just found to have low levels of vitamin d for the third time in the last year and a half.    have been having various symptoms during that time, including joint pain, eyes that are sensitive to light and generally a little poorer vision than before, and heartburn or acid reflux (though that symptom has improved a lot).    i received numerous tests for those symptoms, and the vitamin d deficiency was the only thing that the tests found.    the previous two times i tested low for vitamin d, my doctor had me take 50,000 units once a week, for 8 weeks the first time and 12 weeks the second time.    i never noticed any improvement in my symptoms after taking the vitamin d, though my vitamin d level improved to a normal level.    i take a multivitamin daily which contains vitamin d, and also drink orange juice fortified with vitamin d and calcium, but that hasn seemed to prevent my vitamin d level from becoming low again after i stop taking the high doses of vitamin d.i was wondering if i should be taking a relatively high level of vitamin d all the time, rather than just for a couple months at a time.    is it normal to have low levels of vitamin d even when you are getting some from a multivitamin and fortified juice, or might that indicate ism not absorbing it well?    also, since i never saw any improvement with my symptoms after taking high doses of vitamin d, could that be because my vitamin d level want in the normal range for a long enough time for my symptoms to improve, or might that mean that the vitamin d deficiency isn the actual cause of the symptoms?    could the vitamin d deficiency itself be a symptom of whatever is causing the other symptoms, or is it more likely that it is the root cause of the problem?
3895,on december th, 2006, i sustained a nasty laceration to my forearm after falling on a glass which subsequently took a touch out my arm which left me with a hanging skin flap. on attending the a&e kept, they inserted 7 stitches, however i then got an infection so the stitches had to come out, i attended the hospital on a daily basis to get dressings changed as laceration was very deep. thereafter attended my local practise nurse for a further 4 weeks until wound had healed on the outside. i realise i am going to be left with a nasty scar, but my concerns are that the flap of skin is still raised and not level with my arm, what i was wondering was will this ever reduce and eventually be level again.i would rather not be looking at cosmetic surgery !!look forward to hearing your advice.

3908,my 3 year old son is completely out of control. his father and i have been divorced for 2 years. his father has not seen him in over a month and the last time they saw each other, he was the witness to physical abuse(from his father) to me.we have recently moved in with his grandparents..where of course he gets away with more. his behavior has seen to drasticaly change within the last few months. he attends daycare where they say that he is the typical 3 year old little boy. nothing major! when he stays with his grandparents alone, they will tell me he was angel. with me.. he does not listen, he hits me, he kicks and hits anything around, has a temper antrum, and flaps and hits himself in the face, inches his self, pulls his hair. he yells at me slums doors, and throw things. i do discipline him..i know i do let him get away with something he shouldn but it doesn seem that spanning with my hand or belt is helping and i have even tried just talking to him without spanning him. he knows when he does something wrong!    i know as being a single mother of a child who doesn have a active father i feel a bit guilty when i continuously have to sank him or yell at him. i want him to grow up with good morals and values.which basically is the complete opposite of his father. i want him to respect me and others and have the manners that he should. what do i do. i am open to any suggestions!!
3909,my 3.6 or old girl is bladder trained and refuses to poor in petty.    she wears underwear and loops in it and it doesn bother her.    if we make her sit in the bathroom, she just cries and wont go.....helpthis discussion is related almost 4, withholding stool and refusing to poor in petty.
3910,i dont know if it is because i read too much, but my son seems to be exhibiting clot of the symptoms of a sociopath.    first of all, we have 2 dogs.    one is a medium size year old dog and the other is a small puppy.    the medium dog, he always pulls her tail and paws and steps on her paws or he tries to sit on her.    he does this just to hear her yelp.    that is what is so disturbing.    he hears her yelp and then he will mimicked the sound and then try to hurt her again until i physically pull him off of her.    he has now excavated to munching the poor dog, and the dog is getting closer to actually biting him.    i have tried to punish him every way possible, and nothing works.    i take away everything from him and he could care less.    its when i take all his things away and ground him that he does it even more because he has almost nothing to do.    and the poor puppy - he was gentle when we first got him, but now he pick him up by the head and throws him onto the floor and he always tries to make sure that the puppy does not land on its feet.my son is 4 years old.    i see that some of these things he is getting from the to & plantation (at grandpa's), but he also has a temper that i cannot control.    my father is the only one that seems to be the one that can sometimes get him to calm down.    i rib him.    his father is not in the picture.but, my son can be very sweet at times, and he is very protective of me, and he is very much a matas boy.    i also know that this altogether is so close to what a sociopath is thought to start out like as children, and i am left to wonder, is my child one, or am i just a really paranoid bad mother?
3911,we have a 7 year old daughter who exhibits an inability to south herself to sleep.    we have tried rewards - punishments.     it is almost like she just can  t let go of the day.    we have to be within her sight at bed or she has a fit.    we have gone from sitting on the bed to the floor to the door way to the halfway but just canst seem to get past this.    some nights this could take an hour or two.    we have done night lights.    she wears my watch to bed for comfort.    we are so frustrated in her inability to go to sleep.    what we find astonishing is she goes 110% all the time and just can  t seem to shut down or even slow down.    we have recently started a   daily journal   in an effort to reap the day so that we can   remember it.    this seemed to have helped but only slightly.    we do have a very structures routine in an efforts to slow the day down and bring it to a close.    that is bath at 7:30 bed and book by 8 and lights out by 8:15.    if we can get    her to be still and quite for just 30 seconds  ..i mean it 30 seconds she out.    but getting that 30 seconds is sometimes the most trying time of the day.a little history i am divorced and she is a result of my first marriage.    she has been and continues to go to therapy weekly for this as well as anger management issues.    she has some abandonment issues we are attempting to work through.    i have recently   discovered   that when she was at her      real   dad  s (when we had shared custody) he would put her to bed and then go out locking the doors and not come back for hours.    i can  t even imagine how terrified she must have felt.    no matter how much we reassure her that we would never leave her that we will keep her safe, there is no end in sight.    she can wake up 2-3 times a night and once she hears or see  s us she goes right back to sleep.    problem is we are not so lucky      i would appreciate any advise/help that would allow her to go to sleep and us to get a full night  s sleep.we have made certain that when she is not with us she knows how to contact us no matter what and that she can call no matter what.    problem here is, we live in the country and her dad puts the phone up.    she insists on being with her dad, problem here is when he has her he never around she is always passed off to grand or an aunt or uncle to tell the truth i feel better if she is with them at least then i know she is safe.     but we need to find out how to help her turn off the day and show her that it is ok to sleep.    please i am begging any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.petty

3926,i have a 4 year old son. he has been to a psychologist, pshychiatrist and therapist. 2 different offices. psychologist was first. this one diagnosed my son with have add, add, odd, and old. he then referred us to a psychiatric because of the severity of his case because his thought was he would need to be put on meditation.we then saw the therapist for the initial evaluation. i expressed my concerns. agressiveness, easily aggravated, complete disregard for his belongings, not sleeping at night (by this i mean he went to bed at 8:30 and wouldn fall asleep until midnight or after, and got up 3 times during the night, and woke up at 5:30).as for the disregard for his toys, by this, i mean the punishment would be having toys taken away. after the second time in doing this, he would go and get a trash bag and hand it to me and tell me ok, throw it away. i dont care mummy - at this point he was three. he pulled all the clothes out of his dresser drawers, out of the closet, then, would take the bowl in his petty seat that we had put in his room for middle of the night petty issues, would see or poor in it, then fling it around the room. and gripped the pages out of every book he had. and before someone says it, i did take the toys and books and even the clothing out of his room. this resulted in him using his fingernails and peeling off the paint on the walls. then at one point tore open his pillow and gripped apart his blankets.therapist decided we needed to see the doctor. she too said all of the things the psychologist did, with the addition of insomnia (which i too suffer severely from).saw the doctor. doctor gave us 4 meditations to research in case we changed our minds on meditating our 3 year old. which, we did eventually change our minds on. he was put on britain. worked our way up to 25mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening. he was also put on, after we worked our way up, 1.my risperidone every evening at dinner time to help his behavior issues at night and to help him sleep. which, i must admit, the risperidone did help him sleep. however, the britain, even though it did help with the out of control hyperactivity, also somehow caused him to space out in his preschool class. (put him in pre so he would have other children his age to play with and socialist with in hopes it would help).so. here it is. he has had all of his toys taken away, aside from books which i have him sit and read even if it is just making words up. he is now getting up 5-7 times a night, and has now resorted to speaking food (by the way he has been off all meditation for over 2 months now, so no its not the risperidone causing him to be hungry). he has become even more verbally aggressive with the addition of physically aggressive which is now causing issues in school (he pushed a little boy in his class, then took a toy from another and hit him with it) and is becoming very physical with myself, my husband and my daughter (his almost 2 year old sister) as well. he knows he is to behave if he wants his toys back, but continues to disobey and spite when he is asked to do something. he now also cries, aaallllll the time. for nothing, and everything. he hits and kicks our 3 dogs and 3 cats (yes he has even been lipped at once or twice, which you would think would have had some impact, but continues to do this anyway --scars me more now that he has begun to do this with our kalb, 11 month old german shepherd--). he knows about santa and has been told he will be put on the naughty list. his response has been so? i dont care. you dont tell him what him what to do. hell bring them anyway.so. no toys, he gets sent to his room, is made to do shores, sits in a time out chair, goes to bed early, has any other privilege taken away if it is needed... and probably just about anything else you could think of. i cannot do this anymore. i am utterly exhausted, and have been pushed beyond my breaking point, broken and am almost to my scattering point. i have researches every other possible alternative and tried them all for endless weeks all of them failing. i am embarrassed to take him into public for the way he acts, and feel like a failure as a mother that i cannot find a way to control my four year old son.i am in desperate need of help. please. anybody.

3930,hi my question is that my 5 year old son has 2-3 bathroom accidents on a daily basis.    before he started pre-school he had accidents but not nearly as many as he does now.    he tends to hold until it is too late.    i will take him to the bathroom with him pouting and telling me i dont have to go.    yet, he will end up going.    i dont understand why he will say he doesn have to go, when he really does.    i leave him extra changes of clothes at school so i am not driving back and forth.    when i ask him what happened...he laughs and changes the subject.    i dont scold him and just tell him i need him to be my big boy and go the restroom.    he does wet the bed at night as he is a heavy sleeper and we just dont make a big deal.    we praise him highly when he doesn have any accidents.    please help me...i am looking my patience.    what can i do to help my son?    i dont want this to affect self-esteem.mon

(i dont understand why?)    my son is very intelligent, creative and knows right from wrong.    he makes wonderful grades and is on no meditation (other than an asthma inhaled).    but for some reason he feels he needs to lie instead of telling the truth.    he continuously tries to make other adults feel sorry for him.    i have tried everything and nothing is working.    i have tried time out, taking away favorite toys, rounding him, suspending certain privileges.    i have talked with him and tried to guide him the best i can.    but right now nothing is working.    does anyone have any suggestions?

3942,i am 42 or female who was in relationship for eyes,when we met we both liked to entertain,party,and have a bottle of wine between us every night,as time went on my partner would increase the amount of alcohol he brought home from 1 bottle to 2, to 3 etc, i found myself drinking as much as he was although i could never handle it like him,he seemed to keep it together,i would blank out/pass out etc,this went on for the first eyes of our relationship,there were so many arguments every night (which i always seemed to get the blame of next day,even though i knew he had thrown me out into the garden,into tables,thrown on the floor etc,trying to tell him this he just said i slipped and fell as i was so drunk.we did throw him out numerous times but things he said would get better,so ind let him back in,then i found out i was pregnant with my now 2 or old son whom i lui very much,through my pregnancy i never touched a drop and for 6 the after although my partner did by himself,but even more when he had a friend or 2 round. i did start to have a couple with him but again its gradually got more and more like before and the pushing ,shoving,verbal started again,and as usual its all my fault as i was too drunk,and fell on the floor etc, last week i ended up with a burst chin,he said i fell but i know i was pushed. i just think to myself why does he make out everything is all my doing,is it to take the spotlight off himself ?? i feel i gradually got in a rut and dependent on alcohol in this relationship,now i am on my own and haven touched a drove however is still having a couple and is living elsewhere,he keeps saying that we should get back together but i know it wouldn work as it would all start all over again,just thinking did he keep stopping mine up all the time to take the spotlight of himself,or did i have sum kind problem.
3943,my sister is in a persistent vegetative state a month and a half after a severe car accident. she is not responding to commands.    her normally waist length hair has been shaved, she has a trace (s?), scar on her head and appears very frail.    her 4 year old daughter has not seen her yet. my sister always made a big deal out of seeing her daughter and now she wont even be able to recognize her or respond - is it a good idea or not?i think not, i think it will be traumatic for her daughter.    how can you possibly understand something like this at 4? am i wrong?
3944,okay at the end of kindergarten last year my son started having accidents and i was upset because his teacher was calling me all the time and told me something physiological was wrong with my son to be doing that and that he wouldn be able to go to the st grade if it didn stop. so i took him to the doctor they gave him more lax and that helped at first then he got to the point it was diarrhoea and so i stopped the more lax and he would get constipated and i had to do suppositories and that was awful and still to this day he has little said marks in his parts and sometimes not. he doesn know when it is happening and over the christmas break we sat him on the toilet every 2 hours for 15 mind and it helped maybe a little said mark here and there but when school started back up it started again its not a full blown poor just a little and i have a 1 year old and he shares a room with my six year old and i make sure everything he has soiled is always put up where he canst get to it but the other day my 6 year old apparently hid a pair of under wears and my 1 year old got it i was so angry i didn know what to do. please help. i am lost he has never done this before.this discussion is related to year old delegates parts.

3954,my daughter had her appendix out. they tried lap surgery and ended up performing the open surgery. she was in the hospital for 4 days throwing up and unable to eat the whole time but they released her. she was home less than 2 days when she stopped by my house and i noticed how red her surgical site was as well as swollen. i took her straight back to the er. they opened it partially and placed the packing in. she has been on heavy doses of iv antibiotics as well as daily packing changes for 7 days now. it is finally starting to look much better but she still has the nausea.    she has lost approve 20lbs in the 11 days.    just this morning the dr was talking about sending her home possibly with a iv in for antibiotics to continue as well as having a home health provider change the packing daily.    my concern is how can they even consider releasing her when she canst eat. the smell of food causes he to get sick.    how will she tolerate packing changes on only oral beds when she can keep anything in her stomach?is there anyone with experience with this abscess(abscess)/packing process?

3956,my son was adopted international at 14 months. at 15 months we had him evacuated (he only knew russian)and he met the requirements for early intervention for speech and after 6 months he joined a play group for 2 his. once a week. after 18 months of services with early intervention my son tested out of everything--they did the an extensive testing--speech--of-it -pay,just about 4 months ago my husband and i signed my son up for pre-school so he would have interaction with other children his age. 2 weeks after being in the pre-school he was bitten by another child--well, now we are having issues with my son biting. he has bitten x since he first started with the program9since he received his first bite) and is now suspended for a day with the program. a month ago my son met with the sensory person(an outside consult recommended from the school) the outcome was that my son had some transition issues and it was recommended that the school have pictures for him to what he is going to be doing next--something my husband and i did with him at an early age do to the language gap so he could understand or communicate with us. i am not sure if the school has followed up on this but--the consult also mentioned that my son needs sensory stimulation--recommendations were made for that. my son attempted to bite me once and was immediately put into timeout and his favorite toy was taken away--he has never attempted to bite--he attempted to hit once and i followed that same procedure and he has never attempted it again. at home he has the normal 3 or. old issues and they are immediately addressed. i can take my son anywhere and my friends are always commenting how good my son is. now i hear a completely different thing from school and i dont see any of the behavior that the school is mentioning. his teacher are great at giving feedback which i like and i dont want my son to be thrown out of this school. tomorrow my son and i will be doing some role playing and working on how he can express his frustration --i am not sure how that will go but, since he has been suspended it will not be a fun filled day of play for him--i will remind him that he could be playing with toys at school--but. with not seeing this behavior i dont want to put all the blame on him because i dont know if all of the events leading up to the bite are all his fault--the bite definitely is--but at 3.5 years of age he is still working on developing how to express his frustration. any advice or suggestions will be very appreciated.thank you for your time!trial
3957,hi my almost 5 year old daughter has recently been very sad, moody and cling.    she is sad when she wakes up.    when i take her to school she is sad and most days starts to tear up when i leave and tell me that she wants me.    and she is sad when i pick her up from school.    her teachers have also told me that she is sad throughout the day and continually needs huge.she never used to be like this.    she was happy when i took her to school and was in a good mood generally most of the time.    i am not sure if this is an attention seeking behaviour or if i generally need to be concerned.    sometimes i feel like i need to take her to coucilling to see what is really wrong with her.    my husband and i are getting very frustrated with her because it seems like no matter what she has or what we do with her she is money and sad.any suggestions for a frustrated and concerned sum?thanks,frustrated_mum
3958,i have an with month old daughter who has given me some concerns, and she has been late on some of her mile stones.    i have twin girls (fraternal) and they are very different, so its hard not to compare.we are going to see a nuerologist (april with) for possible seized disorder because she stares and bones out clot, and she has done this for a while, but within the last few months it seems worse to me and ism taking action.    i wish i had taken a journal early on to really remember how she was at 9 months-12 months, but everyone was telling me she is fine, every child is different.she crawled at 11 months, and started really walking at 16 months.    she loves her books, i have read to both of my girls clot (and still do) since birth, and she especially likes to lip the pages (and early one, when allah did not)    but seems to look at the pictures as well.    even though she turned pages early on, she didn seem to have the grasping down at that time and only recently does she use her thumb and index finger (holding a stem of a flower, holding small puzzle pieces).she says da, da, ba, ba, ma, ma, but she doesn say it to us to get our attention. she copies her sister clot, head shaking, banging a cup, clapping hands, but no words.    most the time she does not respond to her name being called, she would rather turn her head to a garage truck coming down the street, or turn her head to an airplane way in the distance.if i say    we are going to have bath time, she knows and goes to the bathroom door.    she will be in the living room, and hear me say to her sister that i sappy cups ready, and she comes into the kitchen.    she started pointing at 16 months or so, and she is fascinate with airplane, or anything that goes and started to point to the sky when she hears it, but no words.her dexterity and motor skill seemed to be delayed, and she is a very happy child, she smiles clot, and loves it when i hold her (i stay home with my twins) but not so much with her daddy and i figured because ism home more.she doesn really do her puzzled, and plays (banks them together) with them more them put them together (the wooden ones). she does do (when her sister is not around) her circles with the holes and put them on the wooden sticks (small ones even, her dexterity has gotten better).my concern is that some of her symptoms were cutis (of some sort), or some type of delay, only did our pediatrician recommend a neurologist to rule out seized disorder.    i also thought to have her hearing checked (even though she can hear an airplane from a mile away) and then maybe a referral to the mind institute at und.i appreciate your attention to this issue, as it is very important for me to do everything and anything i can.    i have also (just for the hell of it) thought to do the no lumen no cassel diet.    maybe i will try whole foods and see if i can find a book to help me with constructing a cf/of diet.kind regards,jennies
3959,ism a victim of severe hair loss, which i believe is related to hypothyroidism, so i started taking bitten. at first i only used 1000 mug daily for a month, and the only difference have noticed was the edges of my eyebrows were growing slightly. when i went to the store to buy more, the only dosage they had left was 10,000 mug so i bought it. being a sufferer of hypothyroidism (even though i have not been diagnosed, i know i have it), is it safe to take? also, my mother would like to take them also and she takes high blood pressure and cholestrol beds daily.

3968,my 5 year old son is very upset when his penis become erect. when asked if it hurts, he says no. when he is busy playing outside or watching a favorite cartoon, he doesn display this behavior. sometimes, he does use this as a way to get attention from my husband and i. weave tried ignoring the behavior and trying to distract him, but it is troubling that he is so upset by it. unfortunately, he pulls on the penis and hits it to try to get the erection to go away, which makes the problem worse, of course. weave explained that this is supposed to happen and that it happens to all boys. he doesn attend daycare and spends his time with his 4 1/2 year old brother and his stay-at-home dad, so we know that he hasn observed this behavior in other kiss. i am hoping for some advice about how to help my son become less concerned about this. thank you.
3969,i recently attended parent/teacher conferences for my 5 year old daughter.    her teacher told me that she is concerned about my daughter as she is not interested in playing with the other children.    i was told that during play time, she doesn really engage herself in any particular activity, but seems to be in her own world.    when at home, she plays with her older and younger sister (she is the middle child), with her dad and i, and plays easily alone with her toys.    even though she initiated play at home, i now look back and remember times where i have picked her up from sunday school or another activity, and noticed her alone in the classroom instead of interesting with others.    when i asked her why she doesn play with the toys or kiss at school, she just says she doesn want to and doesn like any of the toys.    she is also very resistant to do activities that the others are doing, or is the last one to finish or finally participate!    ism not sure what to think or do!    her teacher said that she seems like a typical middle child and that she needs purpose! i was crushed to hear this!    i spend time with all of my children and try to give them as much individual attention as i can, but obviously ism lacking as a mon and feel like a failure!!!does anyone have any insight or advice on this?    how can i help my daughter??!!    thank you!
3970,my daughter was a healthy typical teenager who had all required vaccines throughout her life.    when gardasil was suggested by her new doctor, i, as a responsible parent, agreed.    she had just been given a clean bill of health for cheer leading, and then within 20 minutes she was extremely ill and has yet to recover, 1 1/2 years later.    her story is only one of hundreds of thousands locally.    i am not anti-vaccine!    i am just anti-gardasil and canst not warn others of the side effects that are written off as incidental. truthaboutgardasil.org is a site to see stories of others as well as information with proof of the hidden adverse effects of this vaccine.
3971,i have a 7 or. daughter, that i cannot seem to get through too.    i have asked her educators if she acts out in class and they have all replied no! the only complaint i get from her teachers is that she rushes her work, and does not take pride in her work.     but, at home she is a nightmare.    she will not listen, follow directions, lives in a pig sty in her room until i go in and empty it, will just become very excited and not focus on anything.    nothing matters to her, to use a positive reinforcement, negative canst even be considered ; it only gets worse.    she does not eat an excessive about of sweets, maybe one small treat a day,every thing else is very well balanced. i would just love to find a way to make her hear me when she gets this way.    it is not every second, but some weeks it is more than others. is this add? is this just a little girl who likes to be very free spirited?    what does one do?

3975,so far, i have been to two cosmetic docs.    i never go to just one doctor.the first doctor i went to took my photo very close (2 feet away),    while the second doctor took my photo over 6 feet away!!!     what is up with that?i asked the second doctor why he was further away, and he looked at me grazed.    he said that the first thing they learn in med school is to be about 6-7 feet away from patient.that worries me a lot.
3976,my 6 year old step-daughter has been without her mother for the last couple of years, she just upper and left her to her father. i have been apart of her life for 4 years now and have been in a relationship with her father for 2. she was a very smart and independent child before being removed from the home by face when she was 3 because of her mother. we have won our custody battle and she has been home with us for 9 months now. speaking with her foster mon i find that my boyfriend and i are having the same problems the foster mon was having with her.she is constantly nothing off to everybody, she would rather play alone than with anybody else, she gets very physical with objects that are around her when she doesn get her way. just last week she had a spelling test and she didn feel like it so she took her shoes off and began to throw them around the classroom. she is seeing and popping her parts on a daily basis sometimes 4-5 times a day. last week as well, she got up at 3:am and sat in the middle of her floor, we told her that she needed to be in her bed because she had school in the morning and she needed her rest so that she could be awake to play the next day. she refused. her father had to scoop her up off the floor and put her in her bed and even getting her head down on the pillow was a haste. she woke her 1 year old sister up in the process. although she has yet to harm her younger sister in a huge manor, i am afraid that she may or even hurt herself. the foster mon had told us that she used to have to hold her down because she would get so violent. she has and still is in psychiatric and play theory but nobody seems to have an answer other than anxiety. to me this seems to be more than anxiety. there is a history of i-polar in her family and they are looking out for it but they say that it is very highly unlikely. i have mentioned to them odd and they gave me no response to this, they just changed the subject. sheds not eating her meals, so i make sure to give her a vitamin every day so that she still gets the nutrition she needs. i have tried every discipline in the book. i have had face, public health, and councilors give me advice and have taken it but none of it is working. as for her seeing and popping herself i have also taken her to the doctors for that to see if it was a medical problem and the results came back negative.it seems to me too that she likes to cause problems. the way that i explained it to her psychiatric is that she has just lit a village on fire and sheds sitting at the highest hilltop and watching everybody run for their lives. i saw one day that her father and i had got into an argument about how to deal with this situation and she sat on the couch, watching us, with a smile on her face. to me this seems defiant. its almost like sheds purposely trying to cause problems or maybe sheds just trying to cry her father and i apart. whatever the case may be, something has to give.my patience is wearing thin and i try to be considerate of her situation but i can only be considerate so much before she takes advantage of it. i dont really know what to do and i think i could better cope and communicate with her better if i could find out what the problem is, whether its medical or behaviour. what your opinion on odd? what your opinion on the matter?
3977,i had my mud removed today and for about an hour, i felt sick to my stomach and cramped, but after that, have felt fine. no contractions anyway =) and the extreme back pain has lessened to just one area.are there any other side effects from the removal?
3978,my 19 year old daughter just told me that a year ago her 21 year old brother touched her inappropriately while she was half asleep.    at the time they talked about it and cried but now i dont know what to do.    i left them when they were 3 & 5 because of drugs and they have been raised by their father (child of an alcoholic) and mentally ill stepmom.    ism very worried about my son who has not had a girlfriend or as far as i know any sexual experience.    i promised my daughter that i wouldn say anything to him about this but i dont know what to do other than support her.    ism very concerned about my son.

3987,my (7 year old) step-son recently smeared his faces in the bathroom as if it was fingerpaint. this is not the first time he has done it, just the worst it has ever been. when asked why he did it, he replied that he missed his mother. (he lives in another state with his mother.) he was sexually molested by his mothers nephew (his cousin, also a minor) a few years ago and did see a doctor for a little bit. his mother is in the process of another divorce, they moved out of the home and into a hotel with her 20 year old boyfriend and her soon to be ex husband has custody of the 2 foster children they were attempting adopt. the obvious answer is for him to see a specialist/doctor, but his mother refuses. what can we do?

3989,i am not sure i am writing this in the correct place since i just joined! my son is almost 19, he graduated from high school this last june- getting him through high school was a real struggle! 13 years ago my older son who had major i-polar w/psychic features took his life , he was 18. my sons father walked out on us when he was 5, then he lost his brother through suicide. i have another son who is married and is really responsible and kind. my almost 19  year old son sleeps all day and stays up all night-he wants to be a pro slater (he claims, but i dont see him stating much, claims he hurt his ankle) he is a good slater, well known here, has sponsors and video out. he smokes pot and claims he will never stop. he says he will work one day but needs time to pursue his dream of stating! i have worked very hard to always provide a good home for him - he was so dramatized from losing his brother that he slept w/me until he was in and grade- i have always loved him so- he gave me $2,000.00 and i gave him my new hand and bought another one! i pay his car insurance and health insurance, i pay his cell phone but i told him i am going to quit in sept.- he yells at me and speaks to me like he rates me-he curses all the time-once in awhile he will come to me and try to be nice - then he back to his usual self again- i feel like i am living with an abusive husband! i lock my bedroom door because i think if he rates me this much what is he capable of? this seems so unfair cause i went through so much with my other son when he was ill. my friends tell me to cut him off financially-if i tell him he will have to go he just say no! i know clot of people will say boot him our or call the police-this is hard cause i had to call the police on my son that took his life many times-this hurts me to the core-what can i do? i have stress related conditions and i want to live again! i love my son as we all love our children but this abuse is too much for me!

3995,my eye sight is very bad.    i had re in the 90's and i am told i will have to pay to correct the scar tissue in my eyes.    is that true.if i do not have a cornea transplant will i go blind
3996,i am by no mean am a perfect mon. i have made my fair share of mistakes, so please go easy on me. i have 2 sons, ages 12 and 15 that live with me. neither have a relationship with their fathers. i have been with my husband for years, married for 1. i have always babies my 12 year old, since he was born my thought was hers my last one, ind give him anything. when i met my husband he thought i was too easy on my son. he was only 4. (i know now i was) husband has 3 girls and 2 of them ages 11 and 8 come to visit every other weekend. my husband is very hard on my youngest son, and has no issues with my 15 year old. my youngest son causes massive fights in the family, normal because he has done something wrong and i feel its my job to stick up and defend him even when he is wrong. i have been a pot smoker for 13 years, (yes before my son was born) never around my kiss or in the house. i hid it in the barn apartment for years. two weeks ago my youngest son stuck out of the house and into the apartment (no kiss allowed in apartment) he stole weed and brought it in the house. husbands daughter told him about it. i had so much guilt for having it around that it was hard for me to punish him in any way shape or form. my husband was furious, he seen it as my son was jepordizing his kiss and his ability to see them. for over a week husband and i fought and my son sat in his room. (everything was taken away from him). finally it exploded between my husband and i. a huge argument began, lots of things were said, he called me white trash and i hit him. he called the corps and told them i had hit him. i did not go to jail, i think because my sons were here. i took my kiss and left for a few days. we came home and all of us agreed that we would try to be more patient with eachother and try to get along. two days later my son was looking for a alien french, husband told him do not get into my tools. twenty minutes later, my son comes in crying, and my husband right behind him yelling. he had gotten into the tools anyway. he was again grounded and pushed (he needed the garden for 3 days). i thought for sure he had realized that he had done wrong and would not mess up again daytime soon. two days later my oldest son came to me and told me that my 12yr old took one of my cigarettes and smoked it. i was soon furious, i asked the 12yr old what he had done and he completely lied. finally when i got the belt out he told me what he had done. by that time i had lost my temper and spanned him with the belt. (i have never done this before). i feel so guilty for allowing the situation to get to this degree. there is lots more to the story but i am going to try to sum it up. my son will stand there and stare at you when you ask him to do something, like he didn hear you, but he just ignoring me. when he does have a chose or something to do, he will take his time, a 15 min chose turns into a 2 hour project. when you ask him something most of the time he whispers in such a low voice you can not hear him. ask him again and same thing, until i yell at him. i know he has stuck out of the house and toilet pampered the neighbors down the road. his bus driver last year said he will not listen to her, and was kicked off the bus 3 times. his teachers say that he will not do what is asked. so i know its not just at home. it has gotten to the point i just dont know what to do anymore. my husband is so fed up he wants us to move out so that he does not have to deal with it anymore. i dont see that as a option my 15 or old and i dont want to move. i dont know what to do anymore. i have called a counter and my son starts next wednesday. i just dont know if that is going to be enough to save my family, or help my son.    any advise will be helpful.

4012,ten realization about mainstream medicinewhen it comes to whether mainstream medicine really works, here are ten important reality check realization to keep in mind:#1) if mainstream medicine really worked, then drug companies wouldn have to commit scientific fraud to face their clinical trials, would they?#2) if mainstream medicine really worked, then doctors, drugs companies and the da wouldn be afraid of competition from nutrition supplement and natural remedies, and they wouldn keep trying to censor or outlaw those natural remedies.#3) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies would gladly test their drugs side-by-side with nutrition remedies to see what works best. (http://www.naturalnews.com/028473_z...)#4) if mainstream medicine really worked, health insurance costs would be extremely low. the only reason health insurance costs so much is because mainstream medicine doesn cure anybody, and patients stay sick, which costs more money to keep treating!#5) if mainstream medicine really worked, then all the other countries in the world would be looking at the u.s. health care system and saying, now, we want that!#6) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies would be out of business because virtually everybody would be healthy and therefore not need drugs on an going basis.#7) if mainstream medicine really worked, doctors would largely put themselves out of business by teaching patients how to take care of their own health.#8) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies like johnson & johnson wouldn have to pay kickbacks (bribes) to nursing homes to entice them to push more of their drugs onto helpless senior citizens.#9) if mainstream medicine really worked, the treatment of teenager with chemotherapy wouldn have to be enforced by court order with the threat of arrest and imprisonment of the parents (as happens in the u.s. today). (http://www.naturalnews.com/abraham...)#10) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies wouldn need to advertise on television to persuade people to take drugs they dont need.now, to hear mainstream medicine pushes say it, the only reason americans are so sick and diseased right now is because -- get this -- not enough people are taking enough meditations!yes... if they could only convince more parents to drug more babies and tollers; or if they could get more tens on four, five or six drugs at once; or if they could convince nursing homes to pop a dozen different beds into the mouths of senior citizens then weed all be wealthier!america, you see, suffers from a meditation deficiency. that the line of mainstream medicine: more beds = less disease. and now, there trying to convince everyone that even healthy people now need beds (station drugs) even if they show no symptoms of disease.so now -- get this -- being healthy is no longer enough to avoid meditations! were all supposed to be dedicated, whether were healthy or not.mainstream medicine, you see, isn satisfied to just treat sick people with its meditations, radiation machines and surgical procedures: it wants to put all the healthy people on pills, too.and what will be the result of all this? imagine in your own mind, for a moment: what will be the result if, say, americans start taking twice as much meditation as they do right now. will americans be wealthier?of course not. they will be more diseased. more dedicated and chemically contaminated. the fish downstream will be even more polled with pharmaceutical rudolf and the big smudge human waste compose products now being put on farms will be even more heavily saturated with meditation chemicals.will that create health for america? of course not. mainstream medicine does not work. and pushing mainstream medicine onto more people will only cause more sickness, more suffering and more bankruptcies across american households.it will, however, accomplish one very important thing: the scene financial enrichment of a few powerful corporations like prize, mercy, johnson & johnson and astrazeneca.and that, my friends, is the entire point of mainstream medicine: to mainland the profits for big parma, sidelong the legitimate health problems of the american people, and streaming the criminal soaking of the rich, the poor and the recently-insured in order to turn sickness into profit.that mainstream medicine for you. ism sure glad i dont use it.http://www.naturalnews.com/028561_mainstream_medicine_health_care.html

4026,vitamin: its dose that does reprinted with permission from the international schizophrenia foundation, www.fathomed.creditor  s note: the following article focused on the therapeutic effect of very high dose vitamin. lower doses commonly found in dietary supplement are effective in meeting nutrition needs, but no therapeutic claims are made.(owns, february 2, 2009) there is a spin to most media reporting on vitamin research. the recent anti-vitamin media lit, led by the associated press and us today, provides yet another demonstration. (vitamin c and e dont prevent heart disease. the associated press, nov. 9, 2008. also: us today http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-11-09-supplement-study.htm ) with a paternalistic pat on the head, the media once again seeks to send you off to play with the assurance that, well, vitamin therapy has been tested, and it just does not work.nonsense. thousands upon thousands of nutrition research studies provide evidence that vitamin do help prevent and treat serious diseases, including cancer and heart disease, when the nutrient are supplied in sufficiently high doses. high doses are required. low doses fail. says cardiologist thomas levy, m.d.: the three most important considerations in effective vitamin c therapy are dose, dose, and dose. if you dont take enough, you wont get the desired effects.effective doses are high doses, often hundreds of times more than the us recommended dietary allowance (rd) or daily reference intake (dry). arm offer, m.d., oh.d., comments: dry. wilfrid shut and even shut recommended doses from 400 in to 8,000 in of vitamin e daily. the usual dose range was 800 to 1600 in but they report that they had given 8,000 in without seeing any toxicity. the shuts successfully treated over 35,000 patients with vitamin e.all the recent, much routed jam study does is confirm what we already know: low doses do not work. the doses given were 400 in of vitamin e every other day and 500 milligrams of vitamin c/day. try that same study with 2,000 to 4,000 in of vitamin e every other day (1,000 to 2,000 in/day) and 15,000-30,000 my/day of vitamin c and the difference would be unmistakable. we know this because investigator using vitamin e and c in high doses have consistently reported success.low doses do not get clinical results. any physician, nurse, or parent knows that a dose of antibiotics that is one tenth, or one-hundredth, of the known effective dose will not work. indeed, it is a cornerstone of medical science that dose affects outcome. this premise is accepted with pharmaceutical drug therapy, but not with vitamin therapy. most of the best-publicized vitamin e and c research has used inadequate, low doses, and this jam study falls right into line.high doses of vitamin are deliberately not used. writes robert f. cathcart iii, m.d.: i have been consulted by many researches who proposed bold studies of the effects of massive doses of ascorbate (vitamin c). every time the university center, the ethics committee, or the pharmacy committee deny permission for the use of massive doses of ascorbate and render the study almost useless. seasoned researches depending upon government grants do not even try to study adequate doses.the most frequently offered reason is the allegation that high doses of vitamin are not safe. that is a myth. 25 years of national poison control statistics show that there is not even one death per year from vitamin. check the research literature and see for yourself exactly who is being harmed by vitamin. aside from the pharmaceutical industry, virtually nobody. half of americans take vitamin supplement every day. so where are the bodies?decades of physician reports and controlled research studies support the use of large doses of vitamin. yet to hear the media (and jam) tell it, vitamin are a granny folk remedy: a buggy- and barrel-state technology that just doesn make it.in the broadcast and print media, vitamin therapy is marginalized at best and decided at worst. is this merely laughable, or is there method to it? one may start by asking, who does this serve? could it possibly be the medial huge advertising-cash provides, the pharmaceutical industry? pharmaceutical advertising money busy authors, ad space, influence, and simplicity. unfortunately, this is as true in the newspapers as it is in the medical journals.let the news media begin by disclosing exactly where their advertising revenue comes from. it may explain where the spin on their articles comes from, too.nutrition medicine is orthomolecular medicine. orthomolecular medicine uses safe, effective nutrition therapy to fight illness. for more information: http://www.orthomolecular.org
4027,my 5 year old son has been regurgitation food and fluids since end of august following a mummy bug...........he was treated for suspected milk clergy/reflux as a baby but seemed to grow out of it about 3 1/2 years , then started with small amounts of fluid coming up involuntarily, and after the gastroenteritis was having 10+ episodes following each meal. we went to up and got antiemitic drugs and antacids. after a few weeks the symptoms had reduced to 5+ times a day but not gone, so we were referred to gastro specialist who has just done an endoscopy and oh test.has anyone else ever encountered this - it is not full on vomiting, just involuntary regurgitation.

4031,i have a 9 year old girl that used to be an amazing sleeper and never had any type of fear issues.    we live in a 3 girl house of dinner princesses and family channel without any scar stuff at all.    a month ago we had a friend sleep over and during the sleeper, they told each other scar stories.    well, since that time, my 9 year old and my 6 year old will not sleep alone, go into the basement alone, go to the bathroom alone, or go anywhere alone.    they are joined at the hip.    i think the 6 year old is mostly milking it, however my 9 year old is in a panic and will start crying hysterical and lying so she does not have to be alone.    pre scar story, the 9 year old has rarely cried and has always been very neutral, now, she gets almost hysterical if we make her shower alone.    we have tried splitting up the 2 of them and making them sleep alone, we have tried splitting them up and sleeping with them, nothing seems to work!    we have tried talking about the story, we have tried rainbow, bubble gum and unicorn...ideas, suggestions, help of any kind is appreciated
4032,our son is 6 years old. he has autisum. the problem we have is that he seemed to find his self privately, and sexual. on a daily basis he grabs himself through his parts. after his bath this evening, i applied lotion to his body, while i was waiting for it to dry, he was rude, i noticed he was stroking himself, he had a small erection not fully, but i stopped him, in just wondering if this behavior is normal, or should i worry that something could be tapping to him?
4033,my eight year old son appears to most as a highly intelligent, beautiful and daring young boy. but then he goes to school and he turns into a monster (according to his teachers). over the past several weeks, his behaviour has progressively deteriorated - he has started hurting the other children, pushing them over and hitting them (boys and girls). the teacher has disciplined him every time and he spends most of the day outside the principles office. the school is now threatening to suspend him.he has started seeing the school councillor to work through his issues (what ever they may be!). but when you ask him what he did, he has a very different account of what happened, saying it was only a fun punch or he didn yell in class, he was only calling out the answers.we have tried discipline him at home for this behaviour- removing his favourite toys, but this only inflames the situation because he thinks there is nothing more that can be taken away from him, so why should he be good?when he doesn get his own way at home - he back chats and has to have the last word and can also be very cheeks (his answers are always highly intelligent). he threatens to throw things, but never actually does - he just wants to scare you.nothing has changed at home for this behaviour to become evident and he says he likes his teacher and the school -does anyone else have similar issues with their kiss? i see other parents with their children and wish mine could be more like that....ism at breaking point.
4034,my 6 year old granddaughter repeats what she says sometimes as much as 4 times or more, even when she knows the answer. she also asks silly questions like what is your name? when she knows our names. also, she sometimes doesn seem to hear us. we have had her hearing checked? what is the cause of this behavior?

4044,vitamin d continues to show promise for mental healthnutrition for optical weakness | grew arnold | atkinson disease (pp) is characterized by tremors, slowness of movement, stiffness, and difficulty with balance. the condition affects more than 1.5 million americans, with 60,000 new cases each year. it costs the u.s. healthcare system more than $5.6 billion per year, with meditation costs for an individual patient averaging $2,500 a year and therapeutic surgery costing up to $100,000 dollars per patient.possible causes of pp include oxidation stress and a high homocysteine level. fortunately, nutrition, including increases in both saturated fat and vitamin e intake and vitamin b-6, is becoming a viable way to help protect against pp. now a new study has found that vitamin d, whose numerous health benefits include heart health, blood sugar health, prostate health, bone health, breast cell health, longevity mental health, dental health, and back health, may also help with mental health.previous research has shown that vitamin d deficiency adverse affects nerve function. building on these findings, researches selected 100 patients with diagnosed pp, 100 patients with alzheimer disease (ad), and 100 healthy patients with an average age of 65 years from the clinical research in neurology (chin) database from the memory university school of medicine. they examined the patients   blood samples to look at vitamin d blood levels.   vitamin d insufficiency   was defined as having vitamin d blood levels below 30 monograms per milliliter and   vitamin d deficiency   was defined as vitamin d blood levels below 20 monograms per millilter.the researches found that 55% of the pp patients had vitamin d insufficiency compared to 41% of ad patients and 36% of controls. regarding vitamin d deficiency, 23% of the pp patients were deficient compared to 16% of ad patients and 10% of the controls.with results supported by previous research examining vitamin d and pp, the researches   found that pp patients have a higher prevalence of vitamin d insufficiency compared with patients with ad and healthy controls  . they called for future research to address whether vitamin d supplementation would improve pp symptoms.

4067,alright, i went to the doctor with complaints about sharp pains in my abdomen. usually they start on my upper left side quite intently and ill feel it in the right side a little later and less intently. after that ill get a general discomfort all around my lower abdomen (not on any side in particular).my doctor suggested i add more finer to my diet (ism a vegetarian so i tend to eat a lot already), get a source of psyllium which i can get through eating kelloggs all ran buds in the morning, and cutting out beans and entails which may be giving me some glassy problems and making my pain worse.the thing is that i dont really think that finer is my problem, although my digestive system seems to be working rather slowly... my stools agent really hard when they come out... just hard to get out. sometimes i even have diarrhoea. so does this mean my problems might be more gas related? and what should i substitute for beans so that i can still get a good source of protein?

4072,hello ladies, i am new to this forum and i am coming here for help. in august 2006, while 13 weeks pregnant i lost both of my varies do to cyst tapping around them. first happened at 13 weeks, second at 16 weeks. (baby survived-thank god) dr. said that once i stop breastfeeding, one small pill will fix it all. right! in december 2007, i stop breastfeeding my daughter and try to get into my org office, but they could not see me until march. so i waited patiently. unfortunately, in february 2008 my body went into hormonal roller counter and org saw me right away. put me on angelic harmony, but by this time i was already so depressed and emotional that angelic was doing nothing for me. (since i had no menopausal symptoms, i assumed it was suppose to take care of all the emotional symptoms) in july 2008 they did not know what else to do since my depression was not getting any better, so they sent me to psychiatric who put me on the smallest dose of lexapro. that helped and finally a month ago, i got off of it.    anyway, my org office is more interested in press females which are bringing the big $$$ then the depressed pathetic me, so i have recently switched org and found a couple husband and wife who are only seeing females like me...with such problems. i like them a lot, but by now i am so confused that i do not know what is right. so, before i ask my questions, here are few more details.i am 35 years old, have no varies, just uterus...i have no hot flashes, sweating, no symptoms if i do not take any nitrogen. i am taking vitamin my new org selected for me. i work out 4-5 times a week cards. i take no mormons, as my new org said there is no need since i have no symptoms. emotional, i am 80% better, but not complete. i did noticed, my sex drive is pretty low.is there any of you who are in similar situation and take no mormons? should i be taking some nitrogen and perhaps little progesterone since i still have my uterus therefore, could get cancer? is there something else i should be doing to take a better care of myself?i appreciate any/all comments.thank you,petenka
4073,i had many menopausal symptoms during my periomenopause.    i had a total hysterectomy in january 2006 because of the results of my hysteroscopy and a mr.    right after the operation, i lost weight and was so excited; now ism 20 les heavier which makes me heavier than have ever been in my life.    june 16, 2007 i started having nocturnal seizures(diagnosed as non-epileptic).    i was diagnosed with cat scratch disease in february 2007 (no wound sample taken)    have been having a rough year.    i have been suffering from depression and anxiety since 2002.    is it possible that the seizure activity and depression are brought on by hormonal changes?
4074,i had a hysterectomy two years ago.    i have noticed a change in my hair growth.    the hair on my head is full and thick.    the hair on my body seems to be disappearing.    it takes several weeks to grow enough underarm and leg hair to shave and even then it is spare.    not complaining about having to shave less often, just wondering if this is normal.    i am not taking any kind of hormonal treatment because everything else is normal except for the hot flashes.
4075,i am considering having weight loss surgery and have been searching both the lap band procedure and open gastric pass.    i was definitely leaning toward the lap band because of the shorter record time and ability to do adjustments as needed, but then i read that it was not suggested for people with immune problems, which i have (lupus).does anyone know why that is?
4076,i rubbed some garlic on my left arm to remove about 3 pimples on my left arm. they disappeared and left pimple scars which i can probably resolve with grape speed oil. after a couple of days, another 4 pimples grew back in the same area. could this be bacteria or infection because i dont think rubbing garlic did much but irritate them, and all they did was shift to different spots on my skin. are there any remedies to kill off these bacteria/germs so that they dont create more pimple scars on my left arm. its annoying.
4077,my sum has had a bag for a few months now, and sheds just started chemotherapy about 3 months ago. whenever she goes through a treatment the wounds around the stroma open. often it becomes quiet large and it bleeds a little bit, she is also on a blood thinner. have taken to taking the bag down so the edges seal, but were at our wits end.any ideas on healing the wound or at least keeping the bag down so nothing leads?also, she has been having an acid like discharge, would this be the cause of cities fruits, etc?

4079,have been a vegetarian for the last five years, almost. there were a few points where i was began for months at a time. right now i do eat eggs and some dairy occasionally but no fish. i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about three years ago...but i have reason to believe that i had it long before. i remember how my body felt years ago...so i dont want to blame vegetarianism for my hypothyroidism. getting to my point- have had pretty bad memory loss for a few years now as well. ism not sure if its related to the vegetarianism though. i personally think its more associated with the hypothyroidism. i make sure i get b vitamin, calcium, opera fatty acids in my diet. have had my levels checked for the typical blood and everything seems normal. its just this memory problem...i dont want to go back to eating meat. but what else can i do to try to help this...along the lines of including things in my diet? anyone have this problem and find a solution or are struggling to? thanks
4080,i find myself getting really tired sometimes when i eat, i just feel horribly drained and can barely keep my eyes open, most times i canst fight it and end up taking a nap. its getting to the point where some days ism in bed more than ism awake, which i know is obviously not good for me. i find it usually happens when i eat past or soup with cracked, so ism guessing its sugar/carts related. i canst afford to cut these things out of my diet as ism on unemployment right now and can barely afford parts and soups as it is, ind love to be able to eat lots of vegetables but i canst afford them and they dont last long enough even if i could. is there anything i can do to stop this from happening? its getting to the point where i have to choose to either be starving all day or exhausted all day.does anyone have any tips they can lend me?thanks,h

4086,my son is 17yrs old and i feel so helpless in trying to figure out what is wrong with him.    since june of 2011, he has had terrible stomach pains, caseated and throws up at least two or three times a week. he has undergone an ultrasound of his intestines, had several vilas of blood drawn for tests, an endoscopy and a hydra scan too.    we thought he may have had relics disease, due to our middle son has it, but all tests say otherwise.    we also thought that maybe he has been having a tough time at school, but his grades are awesome and he has a lot of friends.    i dont think that he could possibly be being picked on, due to he is a black belt in the won do and working towards another belt in jujitsu.    so i dont think its a nervous condition.    the specialist is now short of doing a colonoscopy on my son to see if anything shows up there.    has anyone experienced this, or any family members?    i so hope and pray that my son gets some relief very soon.

4095,is it safe to go back and forth on emerson dosage?i was taking emerson(mirtazapine) for 4 months. i had a sudden yet long occurrence with anxiety, and it caused insomnia too. the doctor put me on emerson for the time being. it helped pretty well. 15mg per night.i started feeling bad again last month. went to the doctor and she tested my adrenals. they came back relatively high with low testoterone. she decided to try adrenal meditation on me hoping my anxiety and issues were steaming from that. she thought it would be a good idea to get off the emerson , as my body is soon sensitive to meditation. i tried. i cut it in half, skipped every other night, and my anxiety came back with a vengeance. i dont know if its from the discontiuation of it, or my anxiety just got worse. i took a half last night and finally slept again. do said if i have to go back to original dose to stability, that would be ok , but that was over a week ago. she out of town so i can call her, and i was wanting to go back to the original dose tonight, as my anxiety is terrible, but being that i have been all over the map with dosage the last 2 weeks, i didn know if it would really mess me up jumping back to the whole 15mg. please help if you have any knowledge of this. thank you.
4096,i am a 55 year old male and i have been having strange but excruciating painful electric like bolts in my knee. they come at random several times a day in strange electric pangs that are so painful that i scream sometimes when they happen. however after the episode my knee feels completely normal.    it feels almost like someone is shocking my nerve ending or something. the pain is indescribable. i have no pain anywhere else and i have never felt anything like this up until a couple months ago and just recently i went like 2 weeks with no bolts? they seem to happen most often when i am sitting down. my knee looks completely normal, no swelling or redness and its not tender to the touch at all. do i have ms? i am breaking out.
4097,i had a lumpectomy 2 years ago and have been on tamoxifen for 2 years.    after i started taking tamoxifen (age 52) my periods stopped for about 6 months and then started again about once every 3 or 4 months with the last one being quite heavy.    i am 54 years old and i was still pretty regular before the tamoxifen.    my gynecologist is recommending that i get a radical (abdominal) hysterectomy since i am still having periods.    i had a d&c last year and had a benign poly removed.    just had a trans-vaginal ultrasound 2 weeks ago and everything was fine. my gynecologist thinks that i should not be having any periods at all at my age and because of the chance of uterine cancer with the tamoxifen he feels that a radical hysterectomy is the way to go.    just looking to hear other opinions.

4113,my wife went for her annual check in february 09 and her obey diagnosed her with possible cancer recommending total hysterectomy and removal of everything. immediately my wife began to shut me out both emotional and physically. before this time, we had a very loving and intimate life. my wife was 31 at this time and did not plan to have more children, although she loves children. we have 2 wonderful children. her obey did not recommend a second opinion and my wife put her total trust in him. in june 09 my wife had the surgery and nearly lost her life due to lose of blood from something going wrong during surgery that was to this day never explained to us on what exactly went wrong. my wife spent 4 days in ice on a ventilator and i feared i would lose her. she is the love of my life and i cherish her. life for us has not been the same, in a way i feel like the dr took my wife soul away from her with regard to me. she treats everyone the same as before but me she treats differently. she is withdrawn from me. we have not been intimate in 15 months ever since the first diagnosis. i have tried to rationally talk to her but she seems to go on the defense and accuse me of telling her of her inadequacies when all i am trying to do is ask questions on how she feels and try to get her to open up emotional and physically toward me. it breaks my heart. i love this woman and would die for her or my children. i almost feel as if i said bye to her the day she had the surgery. she has told me that she constantly feels like she is jumping out of her skin, cannot stand to be held or touched, has absolutely no livid or desire to even try intimate relations. i have noticed that she stares out in space a lot, she does not get a full nights sleep, has constant anxiety, constant severe headache, constant tenderness of breasts, nausea, vomiting, and weight lose. i desire this woman so much that it is difficult to not be with your wife and the woman i love to be with the most. i want to help her so bad but do not know what to do. i do know that she has experienced grief toward feeling she has lost something cause she cannot stand to see babies and she loves babies and children. it has been 1 year since the surgery and some of these symptoms i have witnessed seem to be worsening. i have all but given up talking with her concerning intimacy and am afraid to do more than hug her or give her a peck for fear of pushing her away even though my desire is so much more. she has states that she cannot even hold or hug our children for long periods due to feeling smothered. she has since left her former obey due to the way he treated her after the surgery. she went for a check-up after the surgery and came home in a great deal of pain and crying and stated she felt as if he was trying to sweep her under the rug. she has since went to a new obey and the only thing she is prescribed is birth control and antidepressant wellebutrin. is there someone out there that can give me advice and answers as to how to help my wife or communicate with her without her defensiveness. i feel lost and long to be close to her. she is only 32 now and it has been 1 year since the surgery. now my wife is a very private person who does not open up very well and is very modest. i have never went to the dr with her nor do i know who her new dr is. i would love to help her to take care of the issues. any help please. i love this woman. how long can this surgical-menapause last or is she going through surgical-menapause?
4114,i had a total hysterectomy 1/07 and had a laprascopy on 4/07 due to a bump on my lower right side.    i can not wear dress slack or jeans everything must be elastic because of this bump.    dr. said no hernia but bump is still there was referred to pain management.    pain management did not inject the area in question but gave me pain meditation.    after six months of pain management he stated that i needed to go to a general surgeon because the swelling of the bump indicated hernia.    general surgeon said yes it is a hernia but i was dumbfounded so they requested cat scan of ab/pelvic.    results stated    rectus abdominal diastasis, the bump no answer.    i have pain on the right side and when touched more so.    the bump sometimes is more noticeable than others. i have been told that it scars will not reveal the hernia but an ultrasound will.    i will be asking my physician to perform an ultrasound.    i was at my of/gun this past week she stated that the bump and the and/diastasis are not related and she gave me a general surgeon but made no mention on what she thought of the pain and bump on my right side.    i am very confused and in pain. my primary physician has stated since the and/diastasis is bothering me that i will need surgery.     any suggestions. thank you

4117,hello and thank you for reading my post.my father is a end stage renal disease (diagnosed 3 months ago) diabetic.when he was admitted for his renal problem 3 months ago, he caught c. if.he dealt with it for 2 months and had to go back to the hospital.because of the renal issues his legs were swollen, which produced a large blister on his right foot.the blister got infected and he had pretty severe necrosis of the skin area which underwent debridement . the wound is currently filled with the sponge/sac machine which drains fluid (of reddish color). he has been with the sac for about 6 days.i just spoke to one of the doctors and says his protein count is low, so they are looking him up to a nutrition iv. he also gets these among acid cachets which his meals. when i asked the doctor if i could bring anything foodwise she said that the nutritionist is calculating how much protein he needs. after seeing the food they give to people in hospitals and i canst say i trust much the hospital nutritionist, hence i am doing my own research.the doctor said that it the wound does not heal sooner rather than later they will consider amputation in order to avoid further complication from being in bed so long (ulcers and so on).therefore, getting him the best nutrition possible to help his wound heal fast is very important.another thing: they want him to drink this ensure and boost drinks that have sugar as the rd ingredient (his sugar was in the 300s this afternoon). they say that he needs this for his immune system and for his leg to recover. is there better alternate supplement to get?anyone have any ideas about nutrition?ideas about preventing ulcers/damage from being in bed for too long?thank you.
4118,i am 35 years old and in good health. i had my mr shots when i was a child and i am trying to knoll in a college now, and they need a copy of my immunization records. strangely enough, no one can find any record of my receiving the vaccine. have tried previous employers, my high school, my doctors office and the nays kept. of health. my mother is 100% sure that i got it.my question is: is it safe to get the shot again now? that seems to be my only option at this point, as i currently dont have insurance and cannot afford the $300 to get the woodwork test performed. are there any risks, side effects or reasons that i should not get this shot again?any into on this matter at all would be greatly appreciated. thank you.
4119,dear reader,pa is bad for you.there. ill go out on a limb and just say it.your turn, da.less than perfection a perfect world we wouldn do things backwards.in a perfect world the first person to smoke tobacco might wonder: could inhaling smoke into my lungs hurt me? and then, before going ahead to create a massive, international industry, he would conduct some tests to see if smoking might be a highly adjective habit that shorten life in the most hideous ways.but that not our style.here in real world, scientists first synthesized bisphenol a (pa) in the late 1800s. about 40 years later it was found to have estrogenic properties. a few years later, scientists figured ways to use pa in making plastic container and reins that now line most food and soft drink can.but  up oh  pa polymer decays over time, so traces of the synthesis nitrogen are released into canned foods and baby formula in plastic bottles. (pa is also used to make pacifier, plastic forks and spoons, plastic bowls, etc.)by the time researches started studying the effects of pa on animals, use of the chemical was in full swing. and wouldn you know it    the animal tests suggested that pa might not be real healthy. in fact, it might be real unhealthy, prompting reproductive and harmony-related problems.but those results were in a bunch of mice. what about humans?this past summer, da officials handed down their judgment: no problem! let the pa good times roll!but the party came to a sudden halt last month when a journal of the american medical association (jam) study concluded that high urinary pa concentration might be linked to increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and abnormal concentration of liver enzymes. (according to a columbia university scientist, more than 90 percent of americans have detestable levels of pa in their urine.)one doctor told abc news: if this does not close the door on the use of pa in consumer products, i dont know what will.that adorable.here a more reliable take, from a jam editorial: one factor that may be contributing to the refusal of regulatory agencies to take action on pa in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm from animal studies  is an aggressive disinformation campaign using technique (manufactured doubt) first developed by the lead, final, and tobacco industries to challenge the reliability of findings published by independent scientists.and that reality. and that why the da will do nothing at all to protect the public from the use of pa. there just too much money involved.do tells forget about the da riding to the rescue. this one is up to us. what needed now is some water cooper regulation. that is: spread the word. tell your family, tell your friends, tell your workers    pa is bad stuff.parents can find information about alternatives to pa products for infants and younger kiss at these webster: thesoftlanding.com, and recommends.com.and everyone can steer clear of pa by avoiding as many foods as possible that come in can and plastic container. i know, that a tall order. but as a heart doctor told abc news, the highly processes foods that are package in those container are probably actually worse for the heart than pa.

4123,hello,    it started off my skin being super sensitive feeling like i could feel a hair touching my skin.    then i started getting the feeling like bags were crawling on my skin but nothing there or something crawling in eyebrows and nothing there.    now i am having pains all over my body like it feels like a bee bites me, but nothing there.    the crawling sensation is still there off/on.    sometimes it feels like my hands/legs feels like numb.    i have been seeing clot of red like dots like a red pen linked on me all over my body but dr said probably broken vessels its hereditary.    i went to dr .    i had previously been on by 100 my for about 3 weeks because i was told by my urologist this may help prevent more kidney stones. i went off those because i felt like it was keeping me up to much.    the dr said that she thought it could be like w/d symptoms from the by or it could be another type of deficiency but did not think bags at all.    it came back i have iron deficiency but no anaemia and my by levels were normal but low normal.she put me on serious surface for a month and back on by pills 50 my. i was wondering do these symptoms sound like they could be because of a iron deficient or by low level?    if so how long should it take with these pills for these symptoms to go away?    or what else could it be.    its driving me nuts.    i use free/clear lady soap.thanks!

4140,on january 4 2011 i had an ill laser treatment done under my eyes to help reduce dark circles, the skin is very thin due to damage from sun exposure.    the next day, my left eye started twitching on the bottom corner lid of the eye near the nose.    i ignored it and attributed it to stress, but after a month with no let up i called my dermatologist and was assured these non relative layers cannot penetrate deeply enough to cause any nerve damage.    so i let it go.    the condition has become worse, and now after three months of this, it has become obvious that this laser procedure did some kind of nerve damage.    the spasms are quite intense and only let up about 4 hours a day, when i close my eyes i can feel the muscle contracting.    when i put hot water on my face, both eyes go crazy, twitch and feel heavy for about five minutes.    i remember when i had a toothache due to a nerve the same sensation would happen when drinking hot coffee.i was told nerves take a long to heal (months and years), i have an appointment with a neuro-onto in six weeks and ism sure he can help me with these questions, but in the mean time why is my brain sending a signal to the nerve to constantly contract this muscle under my eye?    how can i stop this as its driving me crazy, i would really like to avoid both or surgery. if the damage was really bad, i wouldn feel anything, correct?    the muscle and the nerve wouldn do a thing so something is going way.    my vision is 20/20 but its a nuisance that is driving me nuts, any insight to how nerves/muscles heal etc would help relieve some of the stress, thanks!

4145,i had a lash 12 years ago, one ovary left in place for harmony reasons.    i am 41 years old and have not gone through menopause yet.    the hysterectomy was done for endometriosis.    i have always had normal pp smear, and continued to have them done yearly after the hysterectomy.    i had my annual done 2 weeks ago and received a call monday that it came back showing basil and he high risk positive.    she stated i should come in for a colposcopy to look at my croix, so i had to remind her that i dont have a croix.    my question is what are the consequences to these test results if i dont have a croix?    are there the same implication to the vagina?    i am not sure if i should be worried or not, what kind of treatment can be done, and just exactly what this means.    any information or direction to find into would be appreciated.    all of the into i keep finding doesn address this situation in hysterectomy patients, it is all about women who have their croix.thanksmissy
4146,to all those going in for bag/his my do told me the vagina is very forgiving, so if they should nick something like the bladder they can stitch it and it heals and i feel much better knowing it would not be any worse than possibly having to go home with a catheter for a couple weeks.....that not the worst thing to me and i thought you may get relief with this into too.

4155,go products are no bargain  at any prices food prices soar and shortage of essential grains increase, ism more than a little concerned that we could see increased acceptance of genetically modified crops. and you should be concerned, too.many governments and food companies have displayed common sense in avoiding genetically-hindered foods, but now they may feel the pressure in their wallet to accept them.lets hope that doesn turn out to be the case. it could very well prove to be one of the worst things imaginable for your health. no one has any idea what the long-term consequences are for missing with the genet of various organisms  mixing and watching at will  and then giving the product to humans to eat.its one of the many reasons that the european union is adamant opposed to these foods finding their way into the food supply. the e has been successful thus far in resisting them.but that resistance could soon be tested. go crops are less expensive and tend to include corn and so  ingredient in a vast array of processes-food june on supermarket shelves. even wheat is being eyed for genetic modification so it can be had on the cheap. (all the more reason to stick with meat from grass-fed animals.)the bitch companies are no doubt rubbing their hands in anticipation of continued food shortage. fortunately, you dont have to buy what there selling. honor those companies that wont include go foods in their ingredient. look for no gros that many list on their packing.dr. a. i.
